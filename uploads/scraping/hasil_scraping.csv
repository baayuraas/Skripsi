"76561199528783285","Отличная игра в которой тебе всё расскажут и даже не только про игру! Ты узнаешь о необычных работах своих родственников, о том насколько много людей любит и обожает твою маму. Также один из плюсов это большой выбор героев с не сложным управлением. Например Invoker очень легкий персонаж с кучей урона подходящий для поднятия рейтинга. Комьюнити очень хорошее, иногда встречаются игроки которые настолько хорошо играют, что ломают все свои вещи и собирают новые так как хотят дать фору врагам. Также разработчики очень усердно работают над обновлениями которые выходят раз в полгода и выпускаются для того чтобы онлайн повысился с 10 человек до 11 ( при этом в игру зашел сам разработчик). Ну в целом плюсы перечислять можно долго, а вот насчет минусов, их нет. Спасибо за внимание, надеюсь этот отзыв поможет читающим!","baik"
"76561198106503136","I only played this because League of Legends put me in timeout for telling a 13-year-old jungler to uninstall their soul.    Let me set the scene: it was a dark, shameful day. Riot Games had finally pulled the plug on my main account after a small misunderstanding involving ten ping spams, three racial slurs (none mine!), and one elo-defining loss. So what did I do? Reflect? Seek therapy? Touch grass?    No. I rebounded hard—straight into the open, masochistic arms of Dota 2.    And let me tell you: it was like crawling out of a frat house fight pit and stumbling into a sadistic chess tournament being played by Russian AIs with gambling addictions. This isn’t a game. It’s a graduate-level course in suffering, delivered exclusively through slurs, spreadsheets, and a mini-map that actively gaslights you.    You think League is toxic? Dota 2 players don’t flame you—they curse your bloodline. A Peruvian witch doctor once told me to feed my courier to Roshan and then die in real life. I didn’t even know what a courier was yet. Beautiful.    The learning curve? Imagine climbing Mount Everest, but it's vertical, on fire, and halfway up someone throws a techies minefield at your crotch. Every character has 42 active abilities, a secret satanic pact, and a passive-aggressive Reddit community explaining why you're doing it all wrong. There’s no “meta”—there’s only pain, and ten dudes yelling in five languages about “item timings” while your tower disintegrates like your self-esteem.    But oh, the complexity. The strategy. The high you get from landing a five-man black hole or denying a creep like a smug little Victorian landlord. I once got a triple kill with a flaming horseman while being coached mid-game by a Russian with a drinking problem and a heart of gold. It was the most bonding I’ve experienced since my parents’ divorce.    And the graphics? It looks like a Warhammer figurine collection got possessed by Satan and reanimated using Valve’s leftover Half-Life particles. Every match feels like a beautiful fever dream inside a burning cathedral.    Final Thoughts:  Dota 2 is the game you play when you’ve hit rock bottom in League and decided to dig deeper. It doesn’t hold your hand. It rips your hand off, feeds it to a jungle creep, and then blames you for feeding. It’s brutal, exhilarating, and almost certainly responsible for 12% of global blood pressure medication sales.    I came here because I was banned.  I stayed because the voices in my head said ""GLHF.""    10/10. Would flame myself again.","baik"
"76561198080449788","Dota 2 is like a toxic relationship—you hate it, you love it, you can’t quit it. One minute you’re outplaying opponents like a grandmaster, the next you’re getting flamed by a 12-year-old playing Techies. The learning curve? More like a learning cliff. But once you get hooked, there’s no escape.  The gameplay is deep, the heroes are diverse, and every match feels like a new disaster (or masterpiece). Just remember: if you win, it’s all skill. If you lose? Obviously, your team’s fault.  10/10 – Would feed mid again.","baik"

"76561198056110994","Ah, Dota 2, the game that's less of a hobby and more of an emotional rollercoaster designed to test your patience, sanity, and keyboard durability! It’s truly a masterpiece in the art of inducing rage while somehow keeping you crawling back for more punishment.    First, let’s talk about the gameplay: What a joy it is to spend 45 minutes meticulously building your hero, only to have one teammate feed the enemy like they're running a charity buffet. Don’t even get me started on the absolute thrill of random matchmaking—because why would you want a balanced game when you can be paired with someone who just discovered what a mouse is?    The graphics? Oh, they’re great! The perfect eye candy to distract you from the existential crisis of watching your ancient crumble while your team argues about whose fault it is in chat. And the community! Such a warm, welcoming group of individuals who will kindly explain, in great detail, how you should uninstall the game after every minor mistake.    But the fun doesn’t stop there! No, because even after losing your 10th ranked match in a row and smashing your personal record for “most rage-induced alt+f4s in a day,” you’ll still come back tomorrow, because there’s always that one perfect game where everything clicks… until it doesn’t.

Absolutely. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who enjoys suffering disguised as entertainment.","baik"
"76561198307637623","With over 3,800 hours poured into Dota 2, I can confidently say this game is more than just a pastime, it's a way of life. Every match is a new challenge, where strategy, teamwork, and skill are constantly put to the test. No two games are ever the same, and that’s what makes it so addicting. The depth of mechanics, hero variety, and the ever-evolving meta keep things fresh even after thousands of hours.  The feeling of executing the perfect team fight, landing that game-changing Black Hole, or carrying your team to victory after a grueling 60-minute battle is unmatched. But on the flip side, the game will test your patience like nothing else. The highs are incredible, but the lows can be brutal. It's a game that rewards dedication and punishes mistakes, making every win feel truly earned.  The community can be intense, and the learning curve is steep, but once you get past the initial struggle, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Whether you're playing casually or grinding ranked, every match teaches you something new. Even after thousands of hours, I still find myself improving and discovering new ways to outplay opponents.  Dota 2 is not just a game, it's a never-ending battle of wits and reflexes that keeps you coming back for more. If you’re willing to invest the time and effort, it’s one of the most satisfying and competitive experiences out there.","baik"

"76561199705738551","EXPOSING THE TRUTH OF THIS GAME: Dota 2 has a ""you win some, you lose some"" algorithm. If you're an average or bad player, you might not ever notice. The developers know that if someone wins all the time, they'll get bored and quit. Same goes for bad players who lose all the time. So the matchmaking algorithm is rigged to put 10 players together 5v5 based on their statistics and data. So if you have won some in a row, or more wins than loses, you will find yourself thinking... wow this match sucks... its like its rigged. Yeah. That's because it is rigged. And can you exit the game? NOPE. You're chained to the mouse and keyboard for up to 1 hour just to please this algorithm. If you quit, you'll be given a penalty. IF you get a lot of penalties, and or reports, you will be put in a HIDDEN SHADOWBAN matchmaking pool. This is where they put half the cheaters and a lot of the toxic players. ""A taste of your own medicine"" type. Lovely rule to match the ""you win some, you lose some"" rule. But the problem is, even if you aren't toxic, or don't cheat, if you have high reports from being too good or from getting MVP for the match or general reports out of jealous if you understand the basic dota game, you will be put in the hidden pool anyway because th algorithm thinks you're either a cheater or toxic. But don't worry, even if you never get put in this hidden pool, you'll still meet these players in the normal matchmaking because of course Valve does not ban cheaters. If they did, they'd lose, what, 20 to 50 percent of customers and profits? Why ban them and lose money when you can just pretend and say you're making efforts to stop cheating but actually do nothing. Actually, they market cosmetic in game £££ items around the specific heros that are best used to cheat at because they are most popular of course. So yeah they don't care about the players. At all. Another reason they don't ban cheaters, is because in Dota at least, cheaters are MORE LIKELY to buy in game cosmetic items and spend cash than non cheaters. This is because MOST dota cheats cost around £8 a month from forums or online site communities that sell the constantly updated mods. People for some reason use the word hack so I will for the sake of it but of course it is just game mods. Map hack, auto ability to kill last hit hero or creep, auto ability to help escape, auto ability to help attack, full vision even in fog of war (same as map hack), and other cheats.  Dota is such an iconic and classic game. And an amazing real time strategy game that looks amazing too. Unfortunately, it is COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE.  If you're good, even good enough to power through and beat the cheating, then automatically it is assumed that you are also cheating. And you can't leave the rigged games. And you can't go AFK because it knows and gives you a penalty, And the team reports you too anyway. So you have NO CHOICE. But to be a slave chained to the screen ENDURING 4 low intelligent teammates argue and rage at each other and at you because the game is rigged and if you even try to tell them its rigged and to just stay in the base and wait for it to finish in 20 minutes instead of having to endure 1 hour+ of absolute torture, they will think you're insane.  Anyway, if you do go ahead and install this awful game, 1. Mute all the chat settings. 2. Never ever engage in chat. Because you then give mentally ill people a live audience. DON'T EVEN TYPE 1 LETTER EVEN IF THE CHAT SEEMS FRIENDLY. It is a TRAP. 3. Don't ever try or expect to progress any type of level, or stats, kill/death ratio, win/lose ratio, commends, anything. Because its all pointless. A false promise. 4. Try to remember that the matches are rigged so you don't get annoyed! 5. Know in advance, that 90% of games, because of the messed up algorithm, mean that you either have 100% won even if you have a nap or go make a sandwich, or 100% lose, even if you are cheating yourself. SUPER EASY WIN or SUPER EASY LOSE. There's no challenge. Its automatic. But make sure you keep buying cosmetics and spending money to see the ""victory"" screen at the end of the game, 50%. of. the. time. regardless. of. anything. at. all.  P.S. by hidden shadowban pool, i dont mean low priority pool. That's different. in 2024 I think they might have actually got rid of the shadowban pool but its no better. Plus, you now need 100 game hours to play ranked. and you will hope and pray that after 100 hours of unranked, you will be free from the toxic players and cheaters on alt accounts. Nope. They continue all the way up to high ranks. Because nobody gets banned. Because it effects revenue £££. BUT YEAH ENJOY THIS EXPERTLY PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAP OF A GAME :D.

"76561197961034904","[h1]Final Rating: 9/10[/h1]    [h1]Gameplay[/h1]  At its core, Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other, with the ultimate goal of destroying the enemy’s Ancient, a large structure located deep within their base. Players choose from over 120 unique heroes, each with distinct abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. The variety of heroes ensures that no two matches are alike, as team composition and strategy can dramatically alter the flow of the game.    The game is divided into three phases: the early game (laning phase), the mid-game (team fights and map control), and the late game (high-stakes engagements and sieging). Players must balance farming for gold, pushing lanes, securing objectives like towers and Roshan (a powerful neutral boss), and engaging in team fights. The complexity of Dota 2 comes from managing these elements while coordinating with your team, outmaneuvering your opponents, and making game-changing decisions under pressure.    [h1]Heroes and Roles[/h1]  The vast hero pool is one of Dota 2’s greatest strengths. Heroes are generally divided into roles such as carry, support, initiator, and disabler, though many heroes can fit multiple roles depending on how they are played. Each hero has a unique set of abilities, which often interact with one another in surprising ways. This makes team composition and synergy crucial for success.    Carries are heroes who tend to be weak in the early game but become powerful later, carrying the team to victory if they farm well.  Supports protect the carries, control the map with wards, and provide valuable utility through healing, disables, or other buffs.  Initiators start fights with abilities that can catch enemies off guard, often turning the tide of the game.  Mastering a hero is a rewarding experience, but the constant updates and balance patches mean players must continuously adapt their playstyles and strategies.    [h1]Learning Curve and Complexity[/h1]  One of the most defining aspects of Dota 2 is its notoriously steep learning curve. New players can be easily overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information they need to absorb: hero abilities, item builds, map awareness, last-hitting, positioning, and the intricacies of teamwork. The game does offer tutorials and an in-game guide system that helps ease newcomers into the basics, but even these can feel insufficient given the depth of the game.    Experienced players often cite Dota 2 as a game of ""infinite learning."" Even veterans with thousands of hours logged continue to discover new strategies and tricks. The game rewards dedication, and players who are willing to invest the time to learn will find themselves constantly improving.    However, this complexity can also be a barrier to entry. Players who are unwilling to put in the effort to learn the game’s systems may find themselves frustrated, especially since poor individual performance can negatively impact the entire team.    [h1]Community and Esports[/h1]  Dota 2 has one of the most passionate and diverse player bases in the gaming world. Its free-to-play model allows anyone to access the full game without paying for heroes or other gameplay advantages, ensuring a level playing field. However, Dota 2's community can be both a blessing and a curse. While many players are eager to help and share strategies, others can be toxic, especially in lower skill brackets. Negative behavior like flaming and blaming teammates can sometimes overshadow the cooperative nature of the game.    On the esports front, Dota 2 shines brightly. Valve’s annual tournament, The International (TI), has broken records for the largest prize pools in esports history, with crowd-funded prize pools often exceeding $30 million. The tournament is a spectacle, showcasing the game at its highest level, with professional players demonstrating mind-blowing levels of skill, teamwork, and strategy. Watching TI or other major Dota 2 events can be an educational experience for aspiring players, as it reveals the depths of the game’s potential.    [h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]  The visual presentation of Dota 2 is polished and artistically refined. The game runs on Valve’s Source 2 engine, which allows for smooth performance and detailed graphics, even on mid-range systems. Each hero is uniquely designed, making them instantly recognizable both visually and through their animations. Spells and abilities are animated clearly, which is essential in a game where visual clarity can mean the difference between winning or losing a fight.    The sound design in Dota 2 complements the visual experience, with distinct audio cues for each hero's abilities and ultimate moves. This adds to the game’s tactical depth, as skilled players can recognize what is happening just by listening to the sounds of a battle. The voice acting is another strong point, with each hero having a distinctive personality, often taunting enemies or celebrating victories with memorable lines.    [h1]Monetization[/h1]  Despite being free-to-play, Dota 2 offers a wide array of cosmetic items, from skins and custom hero models to unique ward appearances, couriers, and announcer packs. Valve has implemented a Battle Pass system that ties into The International, offering players seasonal rewards and cosmetics while contributing to the prize pool for the tournament.    Importantly, all purchasable items in Dota 2 are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay. This ensures that the game remains fair for everyone, with no ""pay-to-win"" elements. Players who do not want to spend money can still access all heroes, maps, and game modes without restriction.    [h1]Replayability and Time Commitment[/h1]  Dota 2 offers virtually infinite replayability. With over 120 heroes and countless combinations of strategies, no two games feel exactly the same. Each match is dynamic, with shifting objectives, unpredictable team fights, and constantly evolving meta-games. Players who enjoy a game where learning never truly stops will find themselves coming back again and again.    However, the time commitment required to play Dota 2 is significant. Matches typically last between 30 to 50 minutes, and a particularly competitive game can easily go over an hour. This, combined with the steep learning curve, means Dota 2 demands a lot of its players. For those willing to invest the time, the game’s depth is rewarding, but more casual players might find it difficult to stay engaged over long periods.    [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  Dota 2 is a masterpiece of strategic depth, skill-based gameplay, and complex team dynamics. Its blend of hero variety, constant updates, and a thriving esports scene makes it one of the most enduring games in the MOBA genre. However, the game’s steep learning curve, time-consuming matches, and sometimes toxic community can be off-putting to new players. Despite these challenges, Dota 2 remains a highly rewarding experience for those who are willing to put in the effort to master its intricacies.    [b]Pros:[/b]  • Vast hero pool and strategic depth.  • Free-to-play with no gameplay advantages tied to purchases.  • Regular updates and new content.  • Thriving esports scene with huge prize pools.  • High replayability with endless tactical possibilities.    [b]Cons:[/b]  • Steep learning curve can be intimidating for new players.  • Matches can last over an hour, requiring significant time commitment.  • Occasional toxicity within the community.  • Complex mechanics can be overwhelming at first.    [h1]Final Rating: 9/10[/h1]  Dota 2 is a game of immense complexity and depth that rewards dedication. For players seeking a challenging and highly competitive MOBA experience, it is second to none. However, its steep learning curve and lengthy matches may not be for everyone. Nevertheless, Dota 2 stands as one of the most compelling and strategically rich games available today.","baik"

"76561199097802766","I use to be a League of Legends player.  My friend for years kept harassing me to play Dota 2. He was insistent that Dota was the greatest MOBA to exist, the original but far better game. Immature and young i retorted his statement for years, blind with stupidity.  Then in 2022 i grew up, moved out, lived on my own, i finally said okay ill give Dota a chance, and immediately fell in love with the game. The Complexity and vast array of strategical possibilities were unparalleled, after playing Dota, LOL seemed like a oversimplified kids game for degenerate adults. In 1 year of playing the game i climbed through the ranks to ancient 5. I treasure the amount of exhilarating and unforgettable experiences I've had playing this game. Unfortunately life catches up to you and my time on this great game has come to a near halt.

"76561199747537087","This review is coming from someone who initially started playing DOTA back in the days, moved to DOTA 2 when it first got launched and some years later moved again to League. I haven't touched DOTA 2 since around 2017.    What kept me away mostly was the duration of the matches. Some even went for more than 50 minutes and this for me was just not a viable option.    When I tried now Turbo Mode, everything changed. This mode allows you to have faster games even to League and it packs all the good stuff and fun in it. It's a rush mode, but in itself, the games does not feel rushed. It might at first, because you will see your leveling up and building items, but slowly you will adapt to the pacing and see that it does not make a huge change in terms of pacing.    Other than that, DOTA has some of the best mechanics out there and in my opinion, they are way superior than League's, simply because of the amount of extra actions you can do as a player throughout the match.  Complexity does bring a little barrier though, because even if I have not seen as much toxicity, what I can say that people are not so friendly to new players. But with enough patience, you can ignore them (the reporting system is also very good, every report I made for toxic players, brought actions towards them and the game confirms it for you when) and there is also a new player mode.    The game has a fairly good tutorial system and a new player mode, which could help with that. The tutorial is pretty long and it's full of short scenarios that teach the mechanics in-game. It is really good compared to other MOBA's, which simply lack this at all.    The monetization system is also much more player-friendly than other games, such as League.  There is the aspect of loot-boxes, but the game does not limit you to use the community market to buy skins for prices as low as 0.04 per an entire skin set. Most of them are around an euro/two, but still, nothing even close to the 10/20 euro skins in League.  As far as I know, every new skin released can be traded one year after it was implemented to the game, so if you wanna save some money, you can simply wait and buy the previous released skins for a much cheaper price.    You can also try the Arcade, which is basically custom maps with custom mechanics. Personally, i LOVE to play Tower Defence modes and the Arcade mode has a few of them.    Ultimately, DOTA is a beautiful game, complex in its own way and will guarantee you fun if you approach it in that way. So give it a try and see for yourself.","baik"

"76561198242530534","(Played from 2015–2020)  Dota 2 is an amazing game, no doubt about it. The complexity, variety, and depth make it a masterpiece in its genre. No two matches are ever the same, which keeps things fresh and exciting every time you play. It’s especially fun with friends, where teamwork and coordination can lead to some of the most satisfying victories you’ll ever experience in gaming.  But beware—this game is highly addictive. Once you're in, it’s hard to let go. The thrill of improving, the rush of a good play, and the challenge of outsmarting your opponents create a loop that’s incredibly difficult to break. For me, Dota 2 became more than a game—it was a daily ritual for five years.  However, it’s not all perfect. Playing with strangers can sometimes ruin the experience, especially when someone decides to throw the game or has a bad attitude. And the addictive nature of Dota 2 can make it all-consuming if you’re not careful.  That said, I somehow managed to quit in 2020. Breaking free wasn’t easy, but I’m glad I did. Still, I’ll always respect what this game offers—its unmatched strategy, intense gameplay, and unforgettable moments. If you’re thinking of diving into Dota 2, just be prepared for the time and energy it demands.  TLDR: A brilliant, highly addictive game that’s best enjoyed with friends. Just know what you’re signing up for before you queue up.","baik"

"76561199118217933","A super fun game to play with friends, but the experience on the Southeast Asian and Chinese servers can be quite rough—especially in China. In matchmaking, there are often anonymous players with numbered accounts who throw games, steal roles, and insult even pro-level players with toxic comments.  For those who just want to play normally, without feeding or typing insults, it’s frustrating to lose points over malicious reports or unreliable servers. Sometimes, you can’t even ping teammates’ skills, and dropping below 10,000 MMR for these reasons is just infuriating.  With the low player base on the Chinese server, some players create multiple smurf accounts just to dominate lanes and ‘smash low ranks,’ which is hard to avoid.  But on a brighter note, I welcome anyone who wants to team up and rank up together for some wholesome, supportive gaming. I’m a relaxed and friendly support main, no drama or stress—let’s help each other out! QAQ.","baik"

"76561197970870292","Well.... I've played for 1k hours and I still suck. But somehow this game is still incredibly fun, no matter the frustration that occurs when you think your team is well built and you end up getting stomped. I don't know how a game with only one map is still fun after 1k hours, but this one certainly is.     The matchmaking is so incredibly atrocious. It tells you a game is a good match when one person on the other team has more MVPs than your entire team has games played. That, or you get matched against a group of noobs and even if you try to play nice, you still end up stomping them. Its the games in between those two that keep me coming back. The ones where it is back and forth and neither side knows who is going to win until the ancient falls. The ones where you think you're about to lose, and somehow you and your team are able to win a good team fight and dive right down the middle and destroy their ancient while none of them have buybacks.

"76561198051539046","I've been playing Dota since its early days as a custom map in Warcraft III long before Dota 2 became the global phenomenon it is today. For me, this isn't just a game it's a huge part of my childhood and personal growth.  From Dota 1 to Dota 2, I've witnessed how the game evolved so called new mechanics, updated heroes, refined graphics, and better matchmaking systems. While some changes felt overwhelming at first, I’ve come to appreciate that evolution is part of what makes Dota such a masterpiece. It constantly challenges you to adapt, learn, and grow.  But Dota is more than just a game of mechanics and skill. It’s taught me so much about critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and even how to manage my emotions during high-pressure, often chaotic moments. Every match is unpredictable and that’s what makes it endlessly rewarding.  My Advice: Don’t play this game if you have low patience, poor communication, or if you prefer solo gameplay.  Dota is not for trolls or for those who take team coordination lightly.  If you're ready to be humbled, challenged, and (eventually) sharpened—welcome aboard.  This game holds many cherished memories, including countless moments with online friends I've made along the way. Some of them are no longer with us, and I want to say: RIP to my fallen teammates—you’ll always be part of my journey.  Cheers to Dota—for being more than just a game. It’s a lifelong lesson in resilience, strategy, and camaraderie. GGWP. GGEZ ","baik"

"76561199199064904","Dota 2 – 8.5/10  Complexity and Depth (10/10)    Strength: Dota 2 is, without a doubt, a masterclass in complexity. The sheer depth of its mechanics, hero diversity, and item synergies puts it leagues ahead of most games in the MOBA genre. It’s a strategy game at its core, akin to chess—every move matters, and the intricacies of the game make it an experience that can be studied and mastered over years.  Critique: But that complexity is a double-edged sword. For new players, it’s an overwhelming nightmare. The learning curve is brutal, and Valve offers little in the way of meaningful guidance. The onboarding process is practically non-existent, leaving beginners to be eaten alive by veterans who seem to enjoy crushing newbies. It’s a game that feels intentionally impenetrable to all but the most dedicated.  Toxic Community (4/10)    Strength: Let’s be honest—there’s little positive to say about Dota 2’s community. If anything, surviving the constant stream of verbal abuse from your own teammates is part of the challenge.  Critique: And I mean constant. Almost every game feels like you’ve walked into a battle not just against the opposing team, but against your own. The toxicity here is on another level. Every player has seemingly met your mom and gone on a date with her (and they won’t stop telling you about it). Trash talk, insults, and outright harassment are standard fare. The report system is a joke, with trolls and toxic players rarely facing meaningful consequences. If you have thin skin, Dota 2 will chew you up and spit you out. In truth, the community is one of the game’s biggest flaws, and the reason many players quit before they ever get a chance to enjoy the depth.  Gameplay and Strategy (9/10)    Strength: When it comes to gameplay and strategy, Dota 2 is second to none. Every match is a battle of wits, reflexes, and teamwork. The balance between micro-decisions (like last-hitting, item timings) and macro-strategy (map control, hero synergy, objectives) creates an experience that is endlessly engaging for those who love deep, strategic gameplay. For me, it’s like chess, but with spells and carnage—an endlessly complex battle of minds.  Critique: However, Dota 2’s complexity can also be its Achilles' heel. Matches are long, often 45 minutes to an hour, and they demand intense focus throughout. One mistake, one player feeding, or even one player deciding to rage quit can turn a game into an unwinnable slog. For casual players, this level of intensity and investment can be exhausting. It’s not a game you can just jump into for a quick session it demands time, patience, and a thick skin.  Balance and Meta (8.5/10)    Strength: Valve does a commendable job of keeping the game balanced, especially given the sheer number of heroes and items. The meta is constantly evolving, which keeps things fresh for experienced players.  Critique: That said, the game is notoriously imbalanced at times. Certain heroes become flavor-of-the-month picks, dominating the meta until they’re nerfed into oblivion. Balance patches often swing too far in one direction, leaving entire heroes or strategies feeling either broken or useless. The constant meta shifts, while exciting for hardcore players, can also feel disruptive for those who prefer consistency. Some matches devolve into ""who picked the most overpowered hero"" rather than true strategic depth.  Replayability (10/10)    Strength: Dota 2 is one of the most replayable games ever made. With over 120 heroes, hundreds of items, and infinite combinations of strategies, no two matches are the same. It’s the type of game you can easily sink 1,500+ hours into and still feel like a beginner at times. Every match presents a new challenge, and there’s always something to improve on.  Critique: But that replayability comes at a cost—a cost that’s not just time but your mental sanity. Dota 2 is addictive, but it’s also punishing. There’s a reason the phrase ""Dota ruins lives"" exists. Once you’re hooked, it’s hard to walk away, even when you know you should.  Learning Curve (6/10)    Strength: For veteran players, the game’s depth is part of the appeal.  Critique: For newcomers, though, the learning curve is borderline abusive. Dota 2 does nothing to welcome new players into its fold. There’s no meaningful tutorial, no hand-holding, and no easing you into the complexities of its systems. You’re thrown into the deep end and expected to swim. Most new players drown—and that’s not just a critique of the game, but a failure of the developer to realize that its gatekeeping community is driving away potential new fans.  Final Verdict: 8.5/10  Dota 2 is a game that will either consume you or break you—sometimes both. It’s incredibly deep, with a level of strategic complexity that few games can match, but it’s also incredibly hostile, both in terms of community and accessibility. If you can survive the toxic players, the endless learning curve, and the punishing defeats, you’ll find a game that offers limitless challenge and reward.    But be warned—Dota 2 is not for the faint of heart. It’s a game that requires thick skin, endless patience, and a willingness to suffer for your victories. And yet, for those of us who endure it, it’s like chess with fireballs—impossibly frustrating, yet deeply satisfying.","baik"
"76561198431602813","I started playing a week ago, and it's been a lot of fun so far. A bit of a learning curve is required, but that's fun since there are so many heroes to learn until you find a few that you can bounce to.     I recommend trying a few bot matches to get the hang of things with heroes and play styles before jumping into online, at least that's what I did and now I feel more confident playing against others.

And once you're hooked, it becomes a cycle of frustration, salt, and the occasional glorious win that keeps you coming back.

"76561198148444934","Dota 2 used to be one of my go-to games for its strategic depth, team coordination, and the excitement of high-stakes matches. However, over the past few years, I've noticed that the game has taken a turn for the worse due to recent updates. The constant changes to heroes, items, and game mechanics have made the game feel less balanced and more frustrating. It seems like every patch introduces new overpowered heroes or items, which disrupts the meta and makes the game less enjoyable for those who don't have the time to constantly adapt. Moreover, the introduction of new mechanics has made the game overly complicated and less accessible to both new and returning players. The focus on monetization, such as battle passes and cosmetic items, feels like it has taken priority over improving the core gameplay experience. While the game still has its merits and remains good in many aspects, these changes have made it less fun and more of a chore for me. Consequently, I no longer play Dota 2 as much as I used to. I hope Valve can find a balance between innovation and maintaining the aspects of the game that made it great in the first place.","baik"
"76561198080370475","Dota 2 is a highly popular and competitive Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve. It is known for its strategic depth and high learning curve, making it a rewarding challenge for both new and experienced players. Here are my impressions of Dota 2:  What I liked:  Deep Strategic Depth: Dota 2 offers impressive strategic depth. Each match requires careful planning, teamwork, and the ability to quickly adapt to changing situations. The wide selection of heroes, abilities, and items allows for countless playstyles and tactics, keeping the game fresh and exciting.  Variety of Heroes and Customization: With over 100 different heroes, each with their own abilities and strengths, no two matches are the same. Players can constantly evolve, try new strategies, and perfect their favorite heroes. Customization through cosmetic items also allows players to personalize the game’s appearance to their liking.  Competitive and Dynamic Community: Dota 2 has a large and engaged player base. Ranked matches provide an exciting challenge and the opportunity to compete with others. The community is vibrant, with frequent tournaments and events that add extra excitement to the gameplay.  Free and Fair: The game is free to play and offers a fair monetization model. All heroes are available from the start, and there is no pay-to-win aspect. Players can earn cosmetic items through gameplay achievements or purchase them optionally in the shop.  What I liked less:  High Learning Curve: Dota 2 has a steep learning curve that can be overwhelming for new players. The complexity of the game can be intimidating at first, and it takes time to truly understand the mechanics and strategies. Patience and perseverance are essential here.  Toxic Community: As with many competitive online games, the community in Dota 2 can sometimes be toxic. Negative behavior and insults can mar the gaming experience, especially for new or less experienced players.  Time-Intensive Matches: A typical match in Dota 2 can last between 30 minutes to an hour. If you’re short on time or looking for a quick game, this can sometimes be frustrating.  Recommendation:  I would recommend Dota 2 to anyone who enjoys strategic, competitive games and is willing to invest time in learning the game mechanics. It is particularly suited for players who want to prove themselves in a dynamic and challenging environment and enjoy constantly improving. However, due to the steep learning curve, it's important to bring patience and not get discouraged.  Overall, Dota 2 is an outstanding game that impresses with its depth, versatility, and competitive gameplay. It is definitely worth recommending to fans of MOBA games and strategic challenges.","baik"

Dota 2 teaches you about resilience, about the highs and lows of victory and defeat, and how every mistake is a lesson.

"76561198083553340","Introduction Dota 2 is an iconic multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve Corporation. Released in 2013, the game is the successor to the Warcraft III: Defense of the Ancients (DotA) modification and has since grown into one of the main esports titans. Its complex gameplay, endless strategic depth, and active community make it a unique phenomenon in the gaming industry.  Gameplay: Skill vs. Tactics Dota 2 is based on battles between two teams of five players, the goal of which is to destroy the enemy ""fortress"" (Ancient), while protecting their own. Each player controls a unique hero with a set of abilities that develop during the match. Here, not only reaction and mechanical skill are important, but also team coordination, choice of tactics, and map control.  - Heroes and roles: More than 120 heroes with different roles (tanks, support, carry, mages) allow you to endlessly experiment with combinations. - Items and Progression: Gold and XP earned in combat unlock powerful items and upgrades, adding layers of strategy.  - Match Dynamics: Games last between 20 and 60 minutes, with the outcome often decided in decisive team skirmishes.  Graphics and Sound: Functionality and Atmosphere Dota 2 doesn’t strive for photorealism, but its vibrant art style and detailed maps have stood the test of time. Regular visual updates and ability effects are pleasing to the eye. The sound design perfectly complements the gameplay: unique hero lines, ability cues, and epic music at critical moments enhance immersion.  Features and Community - Free-to-Play: All in-game benefits are available without paying. Purchases only concern cosmetics (skins, animations), which maintains balance. - Esports: The International tournament attracts millions of viewers every year, and prize pools reach tens of millions of dollars. - Tutorials and Community: The game offers tutorials and modes for beginners, but the steep learning curve means there is a high barrier to entry. The community is active, but sometimes toxic, which is something to consider.  Pros: + Incredible strategic depth and replayability. + Regular updates and support from Valve. + Vibrant esports scene and spectacular tournaments. + Fair monetization without pay-to-win.  Cons: - Complexity for beginners: requires time to master the mechanics and meta. - Potentially toxic players in public matches. - Match lengths can be tiring.  Conclusion Dota 2 is a game for those willing to dedicate time to learning its mechanics and nuances. It rewards skill, teamwork, and strategic thinking, while remaining one of the most complex and intense MOBAs on the market. If you're looking for a challenge, want to dive into the eSports culture, or just enjoy fast-paced tactical battles, Dota 2 is worth a try. However, those who prefer casual gameplay or are afraid of high difficulty may want to consider other titles in the genre.","baik"

"76561198058437603","If you've ever wanted to age 40 years in a weekend, cry in three different emotional languages, and question your life choices every 15 minutes, congratulations — Dota 2 is your soulmate and your captor.    The game is ""free to play,"" which is ironic, because you pay with your soul. The tutorial tells you it's a strategy game, but what it fails to mention is that your biggest opponent is your own teammates. Playing Dota is like being in a hostage situation where you're also one of the kidnappers.    The matchmaking system is powered by an advanced AI that matches you with people who have either just installed the game, or just escaped a mental institution. Sometimes both. Balance? Oh, you mean the illusion of hope?    You'll find yourself saying things like:    “Why is Techies in my game again?”    “Why is the support farming mid?”    “Why am I still playing this?”    Each match starts with optimism and ends with depression, kind of like birthdays after you turn 30.    Let’s talk about toxicity. Dota 2 doesn’t have toxic players. No, that would be too simple. It has biohazard waste in voice chat. The kind of people who will ping your death three times, call you slurs in three languages, then proceed to die alone in the forest for 40 minutes.    The worst part? You’ll love it. Because winning in Dota 2 is like finding meaning in your life — rare, euphoric, and followed by a crushing loss that resets you back to reality.    In summary:  Dota 2 is the best worst thing to ever happen to me. It’s like Stockholm Syndrome with patch notes. 10/10 would uninstall and reinstall again out of pure spite.","baik"

"76561197967501792","I'm hitting 'Yes', but with a huge warning.    The Good:  The game itself is a masterpiece. The strategy is complex, the heroes are cool, and winning a tough game is one of the best feelings in gaming.    The Bad:  You will run into a TON of smurfs. Seriously. High-skilled players on new accounts who just ruin the match for everyone else. It feels completely unfair and honestly makes you want to uninstall sometimes.

Sometimes, you'll play awful, and the entire game will be your fault, but sometimes...just sometimes, You make the play.   And that's what makes Dota a great game, to me at least.   I enjoy it becaues when I play, I block all other distractions out, if I do, I play well. But when I need a break, I take them.

"76561198869796797","  This game is filled with both admirable and unpleasant moments. One of the most disheartening issues that frequently occurs in many matches is encountering boosters—skilled and intelligent yet dishonorable players who, for a minimal fee, compromise the integrity of the game and make matches unfair.

However, learning the game by studying it is cool, but you will probably be under pressure from your own team. This game is like chess, it's even better. You have to think more, you have to take every moments. Get to know the characters, and there are a lot of them, more than 120 if I'm not mistaken.

"76561199212794929","Dota 2 is the granddaddy of making you question every life choice, but in the best way possible. It’s not just a MOBA it’s Valve’s never-ending science experiment where five strangers try to cooperate (and usually flame each other) for an hour, all because someone picked Techies.  At first glance, you’re like, “Okay, just smash their Ancient, got it.” But then you realize there’s a billion tiny things to juggle: weird hero powers, bonkers item builds, and a meta that changes faster than Twitter drama. Over 120 heroes, by the way, so good luck learning them all. Every match is like opening a new puzzle box, except sometimes it explodes in your face.  The gameplay? Absolute chaos, but with a rhythm. You’re farming, you’re warding, you’re yelling at your carry for stealing your last hit. One second you’re a farming bot, next you’re in a teamfight where one missed spell means instant regret. Sometimes you pull off a sick play and feel like a genius other times you misclick and want to uninstall. That’s Dota, baby.  And don’t get me started on the learning curve, it’s more like falling off a cliff. You’ll lose. A lot. Even the pros keep getting blindsided by new patches. Valve loves to shake things up: new items, hero reworks, weird balance changes. Blink and you’re outdated.  But when you finally get it, like really nail a combo or outsmart the enemy? That rush is unreal. Every game tells a different story personalities flare, egos clash, someone always blames the support. It’s beautiful chaos.  Visually, Dota 2’s got style. Clean graphics, flashy spells, and you can actually tell what’s happening (most of the time). The sound design? Legendary. That announcer pack calling your rampage, pure dopamine.  Let’s talk esports for a sec. The International isn’t just another tourney, it’s basically the Super Bowl of nerds, raining ridiculous amounts of cash and hype. The Dota community is wild, sometimes toxic, but always passionate. They’ll argue about the meta for days, but that’s half the fun.  At the end of the day, Dota 2 isn’t for quitters. It wants your brain, your reflexes, your soul. But if you’re up for the challenge, there’s nothing quite like it. It’s the ultimate game of wits, teamwork, and occasionally, pure chaos. Welcome to the madness.","baik"

"76561198865895697","The Game is simple and yet it require you to at least have 100 hrs to understand the basics of the game. The wide range of heroes and items makes this game a little complicated for the new comers which is fine if you are ready to invest your time in it at least 100 hrs for basics and 500 hrs to understand heroes and their abilities, items.  The game have 5 positions and 3 lanes on each side with each position having their part to play in the game. Its a proper team game you cannot side on your teammate's shoulder for a free ride. As far as i understand the game the key 5 positions are 1st the carry as the name describe you gotta do it if your are pos 1. 2nd The mid either you make the game or break the game simple. 3rd Offlane you are the face of the frontline act like it. 4th Soft support you gotta make the plays with you team. 5th hard support you gotta protect your teammate even if it means sacrificing your life. Knowledge is power in this game knowing what to make at what time to make is very essential and crucial to the game.  The game community is not kind and sweet its a competitive game either you win or you lose no in between. The game offers you wide range of communication to use and communicate with your team please use it. The learning is very fun but once you know YOU KNOW.

"76561198181088699","Look, Dota is a Moba and I think people have a perception of Mobas (especially more well known ones) being toxic gaming environment for people who have nothing better to do with their lives. This perception is fair but I think Dota is great for a  few reasons that if you mesh with, great! Give the game a try. If you don't think any of these appeal to you, completely fair.  1. You live for the high of a game. A lot of the gameplay in Dota is nothing crazy. But every now and then you do a crazy play or sequence of events that as soon as it's over you're like ""What the fuck?! I can't believe I just did that!"" There can be different variations but while these moments are rare they feel incredible and can keep pushing you forward. If you're someone who wants a more consistent dopamine rush maybe not the best for you.  2. You love to see yourself improving. Not so much of a dopamine rush, but Dota has a stupid high skill ceiling. You can almost always see yourself slowly improving over time from last hitting, map awareness, itemization, drafting, and anything in between. It's a very satisfying but not exciting feeling that I enjoy and I think plays a big role into why I still play this game, and also why I don't consider these dopamine rushes. I will also take this chance to say as someone who's played both, I do think Dota is more difficult than Lol.  3. You have people play with. Yeah it's crazy huh? Turns out that if you're playing a multiplayer game, it's almost always more fun to have people to play the game with you. Hell, just having friends who you can talk about the game with makes it substantially more fun and engaging. It doesn't need to be friends starting the game at the same time as you but it's nice if you have a friend or group that wants to give it a try.   Overall, Dota is a frustrating but also rewarding game with a steep learning process. If you ever want to take the time to learn the ins and outs of a game then I highly recommend giving it a try.","baik"

"76561198027758678","I wandered into enemy territory like Dora the Explorer and got ganked into the afterlife. Would get ganked again :)  🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics 🎮 Dota 2 is mechanically deep. It's clear that once you understand its systems - items, roles, combos, counters - you can really shine. Even in just two matches, I could feel how high the skill ceiling is and how rewarding it might be with time. Abilities feel impactful, character movement is clean, and the variety of playable heroes is impressive.  That said, the gameplay felt overwhelming at first. Between map objectives, the item shop, and general combat flow, it throws a lot at you quickly. If you don’t already know what you’re doing or take time to study up, it’s easy to feel behind.  👀 Visuals & Aesthetic 👀 This part genuinely surprised me. Dota 2 looks great. It's clean, colourful, and less cluttered than other MOBAS I’ve tried. The UI is still packed with info, but the combat visuals are sharp. Animations are smooth, and the game feels polished across the board.  🧠 Learning Curve 🧠 I skipped the tutorial at first, and that was a mistake. My first match was rough - I didn’t understand the shop, my abilities, or what I was supposed to do. Once I went back and played the tutorial, I understood a lot more, but even then, it was clear that I’d need to put in several hours to play competently. This isn’t a quick, jump-in-and-go type of game. It’s meant for players who enjoy studying mechanics and improving over time.  🤝 Team Communication 🤝 This was a weak spot for me. I tried typing, and even calling things out in chat - but got almost no response. If you’re someone who values communication and team coordination, solo queue might feel a bit lifeless. Playing without friends made the whole experience feel more disconnected than I expected.  💰 Monetization 💰 No complaints here. There’s a huge selection of cosmetics, but they didn’t feel overpriced or aggressive. It feels like a game built for long-term investment, and the monetization reflects that in a fair way.  ✅ Final Verdict ✅ Dota 2 is a great game. It’s polished, smartly designed, and clearly built for people who want to invest real time into learning it. But for me, it’s just not the kind of game I enjoy long-term.  I respect it, I get the appeal, and I actually had fun with the chaos of learning. But I don’t see myself coming back to it. You'll probably love this if you’re into high-skill, team-focused strategy games and have the patience to learn. If not, you’ll bounce off it just like I did.","baik"

"76561198285279875","Dota 2, ohhh Dota 2, you, the parent of the MOBA genre.   I started playing it knowing that it would be a challenge in terms of mechanics, but perhaps that is part of its charm – having the determination and patience to learn its mechanics and subtleties. In the past, I have tried other MOBA games, but I can confidently say that Dota 2 feels different. It is much more dynamic, much more chaotic, and this chaos gives it a high level of enjoyment and satisfaction.  On the community side, I have been fortunate to meet quality players who have demonstrated good conduct, with whom I have managed to build long-lasting collaborations in the game. Being able to develop strategies and coordinate with these players has provided me with an even deeper gaming experience.  The way Dota 2 delivers action and gaming experiences proves that the team behind it knows how to do their job well. While it doesn’t deliver content very frequently, each update adds value and refinement to the game. As the saying goes, “great things come in small packages.”  In conclusion, Dota 2 is, in my opinion, a true work of art. It is a diamond in the current gaming landscape, and I am convinced it will remain just as brilliant over time. If you haven’t tried it yet, or maybe you’ve only played it for a short period, I encourage you to give it another chance.

"76561198087359542","Dota 2: The Pinnacle of Competitive Game Design.  There are video games, and then there is Dota 2—a colossal masterpiece, a test of intellect, reflexes, teamwork, and strategic depth that remains unmatched in the gaming world. Born from the custom Warcraft III mod “Defense of the Ancients,” and nurtured into a full-fledged phenomenon by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 stands not merely as a game, but as a living, breathing arena of infinite possibility.    A Symphony of Complexity.  At its core, Dota 2 is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). Simple in premise, but what lies beneath is an ocean of interwoven mechanics, constantly shifting metas, and limitless skill expression.    Over 120 unique heroes, each with four or more abilities, synergies, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no templates here. Every hero is a universe.    Hundreds of items, each changing the dynamics of a fight, farm, or strategy. Itemization is not routine it's adaptive, reactionary, and highly situational.    No two matches are the same. The fog of war, real-time decision-making, unpredictable enemy movement, and the emergent behaviors of ten distinct human players mean that Dota 2 evolves every second, every game.    Where most games reward mechanical prowess or reflexes, Dota 2 demands it alongside macro knowledge, drafting intelligence, map awareness, timing, risk assessment, and an almost spiritual level of synergy with your teammates. It is chess with a pulse, and every move can echo into triumph or defeat.    No Pay to Win, All Skill.  One of Dota 2’s most defining traits is its purely skill-based model. Every hero is free. Every mechanic is transparent. There are no advantages sold—only cosmetics. Every victory is earned, every defeat is a lesson, and every player shares the exact same tools. The difference is in how you use them.    There is no hiding in Dota. Skill, knowledge, communication, and experience are laid bare in every move. This is why the game attracts the sharpest minds and most passionate players.    The Tactical Depth of a War Room.  Unlike many modern games that simplify gameplay loops to maximize appeal, Dota 2 embraces complexity—and the player base reveres it. Consider:    Drafting phase: Even before the game begins, the psychological warfare has started. Bans, picks, counters, combos—this is a metagame in itself.    Laning stage: Not just farming. It's about lane control, pulling, stacking, zoning, power spike timing, and reading the opponent's intent.    Mid to late game: It's a mental gauntlet. You think like a general. You calculate Roshan timings, smoke ganks, tower trade-offs, vision wars, cooldowns, buybacks, and split-push potential—all in real time.    Every decision can spiral the game in a different direction. Dota 2 does not reward random aggression it rewards calculated violence.    Community, History, and Esports Glory.  Dota 2 birthed The International, the most prestigious esports tournament in history—its prize pool funded directly by the community. TI finals are viewed by millions, not just for gameplay, but for the stories:    Underdog comebacks, Once-in-a-lifetime plays, Retirement runs and Cinderella moments    Legends are made on this battlefield. The community’s passion has kept the game evolving for over a decade, making it not just a game, but a shared mythos.    A Game That Grows With You.  Dota 2 has no ceiling. You can play for 10,000 hours and still learn something new. You become wiser, more disciplined, and more aware—not just in game, but in life. It teaches:    Patience (you will lose games for dumb mistakes)    Communication (you need to align five strangers into one unit)    Resilience (you will experience comebacks and heartbreaks)    Leadership and humility (sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow)    It sharpens your mind like few other digital experiences can. For those who crave mastery, Dota 2 is not just a game, it is a lifelong dojo.    Constantly Evolving, Yet Always Familiar.  Valve’s updates keep Dota alive, balancing nostalgia with innovation. From massive gameplay overhauls to subtle item tweaks, the game never stagnates. Patch notes are read like holy scripture, studied, debated, and then adapted to. It’s a cycle of rebirth every few months.    And yet, no matter how much it changes, Dota always feels like home. The radiant base. The dire cliffs. The pit where Roshan lives. These are etched in memory. It is your battlefield. Your proving ground.    Final Verdict: The Greatest Game Ever Made.  Dota 2 is art, science, sport, and strategy fused into one. It doesn’t coddle you. It demands your best, and it gives you the tools to find it. In a world increasingly defined by fast content and short attention spans, Dota 2 rewards depth, thought, and perseverance.    It may not be for everyone—but for those who seek the apex of digital competition, who dream of orchestrating five-man wombo combos and outplaying a whole team with one clutch move, Dota 2 is the undisputed throne.

"76561197967288976","If you’ve ever thought, “I’d like to systematically erode my will to live while being yelled at in Russian,” Dota 2 is the game for you. With over 7000 hours invested — or, more accurately, irretrievably discarded — I can confidently say that Dota 2 doesn’t just suck your soul. It files a change-of-ownership form with the devil, adds your essence to a punch card, and hands you a battle pass as consolation.    The thrill of logging in has long since devolved into a Pavlovian dread-response. Each match is less a game and more a hostage negotiation where your captors are twelve-year-olds with no filter, teammates who pick Techies unironically, and a matchmaking system that could be replaced by a blindfolded chimp throwing darts at a dartboard labeled “MMR.”    The community, if we can even call it that, is a vibrant mosaic of dysfunction. A glorious melting pot of racism, slurs, death threats, and unsolicited life advice from people who unironically use anime profile pictures and think “support diff” is a valid argument.    Friendships? Gone. Relationships? Dismantled. Playing Dota 2 with someone you love is like renovating a house with them: one of you will end up in therapy, and the other will just leave. If you want to test the strength of any bond, forget trust falls. Queue up for ranked.    And yet, despite everything — the emotional scarring, the social carnage, the existential despair — the game calls you back. Not with excitement, but with grim obligation. Like paying taxes. Or visiting a relative in the hospital who doesn’t remember your name but still manages to call you a disappointment.    Dota 2 is not a game. It’s a lifestyle choice. A bad one. Like ketamine at a children’s party.    Play it if you must. But know this: Dota 2 doesn't just ruin your day. It ruins your decade.","baik"
"76561198445331943","Classic game of strategy so complex that every update changes the game and the way it's played because of the buff/nerf-ment of heroes. Recently the game has introduced many new heroes and introduced many changes in items of heroes as well. I used to play it very often long time ago but recently started playing it again, back in the days the skins for the heroes were rare and expensive but now it seems that things are getting pretty cheap and you can get hero skins for a fraction of original prices.","baik"
"76561198253291986","Dota 2 is a game I love… but it wears me down with endless updates and constant rebalancing.  I've spent many years with this game. I’ve seen ages pass, heroes rise and fall, items appear and vanish. Dota 2 is more than just a game — it’s a battlefield of minds and wills, where every match tells a story. You don’t just press buttons here — you live a full life in one evening.  But with the years comes a kind of fatigue. Not from the game itself — from the fact that it is never allowed to settle.  Just as you get into it, adapt, master a hero, and begin to truly enjoy the experience — everything changes again. Not just small tweaks — entire systems are torn apart and rebuilt. The heroes you knew like a friends becomes a strangers. The item that defined your strategy is gone. The meta you were finally beginning to understand — swept away.  In other games, updates feel like a celebration. Here, they often feel like grief. Each patch in Dota is like a dagger to the heart. They remove beloved skills, rewrite familiar mechanics, endlessly reshuffle the balance. It feels less like creative improvement and more like compulsive tinkering.  If updates were less frequent, they would be anticipated, even welcomed — not met with a tired sigh of ""Oh no, another patch… again? Seriously?"" And please, stop endlessly tuning the balance. Focus on things that don’t rewrite the foundations every time.  I understand — the game needs to live. But there’s a difference between life and restlessness.  This is a competitive game. This is E-sports. In sports, the rules don’t change every few weeks. Where is the stability? Where is the respect for the player’s time and learning? It often feels like the changes exist just for the sake of having changes — not because they’re needed.  To the developers, if you happen to read this — please, slow down! Don’t ruin what’s good in pursuit of something ""better."" Not every structure needs rebuilding. Not every system needs redesign.  Yes, we welcome new heroes. Yes, we love new items and seasonal content. But not every week or month. Let the game breathe. Let us live in it, not constantly study it.  P.S. Special thanks to whoever created the Turbo mode. For those of us with jobs, families, and a life outside of Dota — it’s a blessing. Turbo is like a short, joyful story before bed. Fast, fun, and without burnout.  I still love this game. I have, and maybe always will — unless one day it’s changed so much it stops being the game I once loved. But like any weary warrior, I ask not for more battles — I ask for a moment of rest between them… and for the rules to stop changing. Dota is a classic. It’s chess. Stop rewriting how the pieces move.","baik"
"76561198261061047","Dota 2 is a legendary multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve. It features a 5v5 team format where each side aims to destroy the enemy base.  One of Dota 2’s strongest points is its depth and variety. The game has over 100 heroes, each with unique abilities and playstyles. This makes every match feel different and requires players to think strategically, work as a team, and react quickly.  The graphics and sound design are top-notch. The map is detailed, and the ability animations are visually pleasing. Regular updates from the developers bring balance changes, new heroes and items, and in-game events. Dota 2 also has a thriving esports scene — tournaments like The International attract millions of viewers and offer huge prize pools.  However, it’s worth noting that the game has a steep learning curve and can be unforgiving. New players may find it difficult to get into, and the community can sometimes be toxic. Also, matches tend to last 30–50 minutes on average, requiring focus and patience.  Pros: -Huge variety of heroes and items -Deep strategy and teamwork -Regular updates and support -Well-developed esports scene  Cons: -Steep learning curve for newcomers -Sometimes toxic community -Long match durations","baik"

"76561198030784015","This game has over 2.4 MILLION reviews and is mostly positive.   Seriously, with games like this there's not much else I can add to the vast body of reviews already explaining why the game is good.  Personally I've only written around 14,000 reviews, evaluating each game on it's own merits and the value proposition it offers compared to other games at similar prices.  Most of the reviews I write are negative, but most of the games that I give negative reviews to are widely ignored by gamers anyway, with only a handful of players in most cases.  Almost all the time, I'm just saying what other people think when they breeze on by and browse onto other games.  Gamers ignore bad games for a reason... and they pay attention to great games for good reason, too.  What I'm trying to say, is there's some wisdom in crowds, at least when it comes to games on Steam.  People don't play or even bother buying or downloading bad games.  But when 2.4 million people write a review for a game, it means they care about it.  There's something there.  The more players, the bigger it is.  This is definitely true for DOTA2.   One of the first in the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), DOTA (Defense of the Ancients) was a player-made map for Blizzard's Warcraft 3 RTS.  The map proved so popular that Valve decided to make a standalone sequel (with different mechanics of course) that proved to be one of the greatest competitive game formats known.  Part of the success is the expanded variability of NPC ""creeps"", low level soldiers that fight on your behalf, combined with rich player skill trees, adding completely new dimensions to the old RTS formula.  But I guess you don't need a history lesson.   There's a reason so many people have played this.  Because it's one of the greatest games of all time.","baik"

"76561198275429363","If you dedicate a few hundred hours to learning the ropes, you will have fun. I've never played a more mechanically challenging game before. And somehow, it never gets boring. There is simply too many heroes, items and viable hero builds, that even in hour 700 you can still try something new and refreshing. But the biggest win for Dota 2 is the rare satisfaction in playing against highly skilled opponents, and still outwitting them and winning anyway. That's Dota 2 at its best.    Simultaneously, however, you will learn to hate yourself and everyone else. Your teammates will snap at you and each other more often than not. Internal drama, infighting, griefing, general toxicity and all the worst hallmarks of competitive online games.    If you do play, I recommend taking a month or two off every once in a while.

"76561198321406803","Dota 2: A Masterclass in Stress Management and Friendship Destruction    Welcome to Dota 2 – the game where your nerves are as taut as a bowstring and your brain is working overtime trying to figure out what on earth is happening. If you ever want to test the strength of your friendships, just invite your friends for a couple of matches. It's like a stress test, but with more explosions.    Each game is a unique journey: either you feel like a strategy genius, or you find yourself in a philosophical stupor, wondering where those 50 minutes of your life just went. Nothing brings people closer together like the collective shock of losing a game you were winning for the entire match, only to… well, you know how it goes.    A word of caution: if you have a cat, it's best to hide it while you're playing. After a few games, you might start to suspect that it's somehow the reason for all your losses.    And yet, Dota 2 is like a bag of chips: you just can't stop. It sucks you in, despite all the jokes and those moments when you swear you'll never play it again. But let's be honest, we all know how this ends – a few hours later, you're back in the lobby, ready for new adventures and challenges.    I recommend this game to anyone who loves a thrill, is ready to sacrifice time, nerves, and possibly a couple of friendships. Dota 2 is the perfect game for those who think life is too calm and predictable.","baik"
"76561198367471798","Few games have shaped the esports landscape as profoundly as Dota 2. Developed by Valve, this free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) stands as a towering giant in competitive gaming—complex, rewarding, and fiercely strategic.  At its core, Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other in a battle to destroy the opposing team’s Ancient, a heavily guarded structure deep within their base. With over a hundred unique heroes, each boasting distinct abilities, playstyles, and roles, no two matches feel the same.  The game balances macromanagement of the battlefield with micromanagement of your hero’s growth—you’ll be farming gold, buying items, coordinating with teammates, ganking enemies, and executing game-changing team fights. It’s a demanding dance of skill, strategy, and split-second decision-making.  Dota 2 is notoriously complex. Its steep learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, but the depth is precisely what has kept the community thriving for years. Every patch introduces balance changes, new items, and sometimes new heroes, ensuring the meta continually evolves.  Mastering one hero, let alone the entire roster, requires time and dedication—but the satisfaction of outplaying an opponent or turning the tide in a crucial moment is unparalleled.  Visually, Dota 2 is colorful and detailed, with each hero uniquely animated and designed to stand out. The maps are richly textured, providing clear tactical information while remaining aesthetically pleasing. Sound design is top-notch, with distinct voice lines, spell effects, and ambient noises contributing to the immersive experience.  With one of the largest esports scenes globally, Dota 2’s The International tournament offers multi-million-dollar prize pools and draws millions of viewers worldwide. The community is passionate, vocal, and dedicated, though the competitive nature can sometimes lead to a steep social environment.  Dota 2 is a monument to strategic depth and player skill—a game that rewards patience, teamwork, and creativity. If you’re willing to invest the time, it offers a rich, endlessly evolving battlefield where every match is a new story.  Complex, competitive, and compelling—Dota 2 remains the pinnacle of MOBA excellence.  Rating: 9/10","baik"

"76561198043610692","Wonderful game! Great gameplay, great graphics, fun for hours and hours, it never gets old.   Message to devs:  You guys are doing a great job at retention, but the game would also greatly benefit from having more people play. For this, it needs to be more accessible to beginners, and casual players.  1- fix smurfing. Currently the main issue holding back the potential of the game in non ranked games (where casual players hang). Reporting is not enough, smurf accounts need to be banned, and IPs creating several smurf accounts need to be prevented to do so.  2- Improve beginners experience. The tutorial is good, but limiting playable heroes at start just creates frustration when new players can't play their favorite hero. Instead, have suggested heroes. Match making amongst players with 0 games or 0 victory is a must have (and of course coupled with the smurf fix above). Bots training is great but it's boring. It's very important to let beginners play with other beginners.  3- Skin quality. This is a much lower priority item, but it could really improve monetization. Many base models and old skins have really poor model/texture/etc. quality. The reward of receiving a random skin after a game is negated if said skin is so poor quality that it's not even worth equiping. Also, one of the stregth of Dota2 against competitors is the visual quality, so making sure all models have a consistent baseline quality, and staying coherent with the universe, is key to preserve and emphasize this strength.  Cheers!","baik"

The game can feel overwhelming at times, but when you get into the flow, it’s genuinely fun and rewarding.  That being said, the player community can be hit or miss.

"76561198322379889","Dota 2 is one of the most rewarding and punishing team-based competitive games ever made. With its staggering depth, relentless learning curve, and fiercely balanced free-to-play model, it demands dedication but offers unmatched strategic variety. Rooted in its origins as a mod for Warcraft III, Dota 2 has evolved into a complex multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) that requires significant time and effort to master.    A Trial by Fire  New players face a brutal introduction: over 100 heroes, intricate mechanics, and a meta that shifts with every patch. Early matches can feel overwhelming, but perseverance reveals a brilliantly layered game where knowledge and teamwork trump reflexes alone. Key mechanics include:    Denying: Players can kill their own creeps (AI units) to prevent enemies from gaining experience and gold. This strategic move is crucial for controlling the lane and starving opponents.    Hero Roles: Understanding hero roles is vital. For instance, hypercarry heroes scale well into the late game, becoming powerful threats, while soft supports provide utility and vision without needing much gold. In contrast, strong supports can initiate fights and protect carries, ensuring they survive to deal damage.    Lanes: The game features three main lanes: top, middle (mid), and bottom. The mid lane is often contested for its central position, allowing heroes to gain experience quickly and rotate to assist other lanes.    Pure, Uncompromising Balance  Valve’s commitment to fairness is unmatched—every hero is free, and only cosmetics are monetized. This focus on skill fosters a competitive purity that is rare in free-to-play titles. Players must learn intricate mechanics, hero interactions, and strategies to succeed, making skill and teamwork paramount.    A Living, Evolving Game  Regular updates, pro-level spectating, and community-driven content keep Dota 2 fresh. While some design choices feel outdated, such as finicky tower targeting, Valve’s polish and anti-toxicity measures make the game more welcoming than ever—though playing with friends remains the best experience.    Game Mechanics Overview  Vision: Control of vision is critical in Dota 2. Players use wards to gain sight over key areas, allowing for strategic positioning and ambushes. Proper vision can turn the tide of battles and prevent ganks.    Itemization: With numerous items available, players must adapt their builds based on the game state and enemy heroes. Items can enhance stats, provide active abilities, or counter specific threats, adding another layer of strategy.    Team Composition: Successful teams often balance their composition with a mix of damage dealers, supports, and initiators. Understanding how these roles interact is essential for executing strategies effectively.    Dota 2 isn’t for casual players it requires a significant time investment to enjoy fully. However, for those willing to climb its steep learning curve, it delivers endless depth, adrenaline-pumping matches, and a fiercely fair competitive landscape. A masterpiece of the genre—if you dare to master it. May the best team win!","baik"

"76561198035853026","Love Dota 2. It has so much depth and complexity. At first, I was turned off by the idea that it would take me possibly 100s of hours to learn it, but after playing a few games, I did start to understand it. As a former League of Legends player, I can grasp the moba fundamentals in Dota 2 easily, however there are significant differences between the two.   Dota 2 may seem slower, but man, wait till you get flash ganked by an Earthshaker and perma-stunned then 0-100 in a couple of seconds. There is fight commitment here, and the visuals are excellent. It also doesn't have many skill shots, so positioning and strategy is key. Another fundamental difference is that most items are not passive stat sticks, they do provide stats but also come with game changing actives, that can dictate the flow of combat. It is quite possibly the most glaring difference between Dota 2 and LOL. In Dota 2, we buy items for extra abilities essentially.

"76561198393942753","One of the best, most strategic, most intense competitive games ever made.… if your team isn’t the enemy  Every match is unique, the hero pool is insanely deep, and the skill ceiling is basically infinite. When you play with friends, especially a full 5-stack, the game can be pure magic — coordinated fights, smart plays, actual teamwork. It’s one of the most satisfying multiplayer experiences out there.  But... if you're playing solo, good luck. Dota 2’s community is infamous for a reason. Expect fragile egos, instant blame, rage picks, and people who think they’re the next Miracle after getting one triple kill. Playing solo queue is like flipping a coin — maybe you get a decent team, or maybe you're stuck with a keyboard warrior screaming in chat and griefing from 10 minutes in.

The hero diversity, gameplay mechanics, and regular updates make it a standout experience among competitive games.  However, I would like to respectfully share some concerns regarding the current state of matchmaking—particularly on the Asia server. Lately, I’ve noticed that the matchmaking quality has significantly declined, leading to unbalanced games, long queue times, and frequent mismatches in player skill levels. This can be discouraging, especially when you're trying to enjoy a fair and competitive environment.  I understand the challenges involved in maintaining a global matchmaking system, and I appreciate the effort the developers put in. Still, I hope the team can look into improving matchmaking fairness and consistency in the Asia region. A more balanced system would greatly enhance the experience for players who are passionate about the game.  Thank you for your continued work on Dota 2. I look forward to seeing how the game evolves and hope to see improvements in this area in the near future.","baik"

"76561199198432934","Dota 2 is a 5v5 battle of strategy, skill, and intense emotional trauma.    You pick from over 120 heroes, each with their own crazy abilities — some heal, some nuke, and some just ruin lives (looking at you, Techies). The first 10 minutes are farming and pretending you know what you're doing, and the next 40 are chaotic team fights, blaming supports, and yelling “WHY DIDN’T YOU BKB!?”    It's hard to find a team that vibes, plays well, and doesn’t scream at you for missing a stun. But the teamwork, the clutch plays, the feeling of turning a fight with 10 HP and a well-timed Black Hole — chef’s kiss.    In conclusion: Dota 2 is a toxic relationship you can’t quit.

"76561198123495659","It always feels weird to recommend a MOBA. Its one of those joy sucking hobbies that nobody seems to actually enjoy doing.     However, my recent engagement with DOTA 2 as a long time MOBA player has shown to me that the Sandbox MOBA is the only really engaging way to maintain a game.     League of Legends is miserable because you can do everything right in regards to your role and still eat shit. Mainly because of the rigidity the League formula has. Its constantly telling you what to do, when to do it, where to do it. What have you been doing well, what have you been doing poorly. It leaves a stale taste in the mouth.     I enjoy a bit of League now and then, don't get me wrong. I don't want this to come across as a League bad Dota good review. But honestly, at the end of the day. That is sort of the conclusion I've come to. Dota has such a sandbox to play in that feels infinitely more dynamic than anything League has produced. Objectives are weird and abstract in a way that feels like it puts agency in the hands of the player. There is no get 10 DMG permanently enemy on the map that teams are told to stack at specific intervals.     The way trees are entities engage with like Treant and Nature Prophet, while others destroy and create new pathways and open fields like Primal beast. These things are what makes the sandbox unique and dynamic. Picking a timbersaw isn't just about being the tree chopping guy against the tree hero. Its about being able to fundamentally change the playing field to counter a playstyle.     That's what makes Dota unique for me.     What I would criticize Dota for in comparison to other mobas is the sort of hard countering that often goes around. There are certain matchups that are borderline unwinnable for characters, and this HAS gotten better over the years. No more 99% magic resist Huskarr into a magic carry type situations. However, there are still cases where some heroes just lock out other heroes from participating, and you'll often have one guy on your team and the enemy team who is essentially not allowed to play the game. Other MOBAs like League do HAVE counters, but they are more favorable matchups than they are win buttons as often the case in Dota. What is a Dark Seer to do when a Faceless Void warps and ults him and his team before beating his face into the dirt with half an item to his name? A lot of the time its just hope someone has a setup to counter the counter. And that's not always a fun way to play. It makes BKB a mandatory item that you will always see at least one of in every single game. League somewhat mitigates this hard countering by significantly reducing the length of CC in its game, that way people have to consider more where and when its used and what they can do while its happening. While often in Dota 2 simply landing a stun can often be a guaranteed kill regardless of positioning because of how long many stuns last.     Even with these criticisms, I still find Dota 2 much more fun than its competition.","baik"

Please, my darling, make that in a losing team, the player who received the MVP in it does not lose his rating, otherwise what is the use of this title, which is given after each game?","baik"

Staying together is the key to success  -Dont initiate fights or try to defend a tower if your outnumbered, you'll end up feeding  -This is not Lol, dont jungle in laning phase (0-15min, when you still have your t1). Only jungle if you can carry Ancients creeps after laning phase.   -If your control the vision of the map, you control the destiny of the teamfights  -If your support, do your job: offer vision to your team and protection for your carry and tanks while they bank those LH. Dont try to get LH, focus on harassing and denying creeps.   -Follow the high rated guides and dont be shy to ask your teammates for tips, you cant be worst then a bot.

And yet, like clockwork, a year or two later, I reinstall it. Every. Single. Time.  It’s the kind of game that messes with your sleep schedule, your friendships, and your sanity.

"76561199084204185","By the time of writing this i have 200 hours playtime, played every character a-tleast once and done my ranked placement. This is as good of a feel for Dota as you can get without no-lifing it for 5 years.  Dota like many valve games I've played feels like a more chaotic version of other games in it's genre. unlike other MOBA's it doesn't care as much about balance, and will happily make all the characters insanely overpowered compared to peoples defensives (even with bkb and a full item list of defensives). This makes Teamfights turn into a 5v5 of glass cannons no matter the build, all capable of killing eachother in less than 3 seconds which makes split second descisions more heavily weighted. The lack of many skillshots means that (unlike league of legends) the idea of strafing between attacks just doesn't exist. From my limited experience, most teamfights will have the carry be invisible or hidden until the fight starts, then stand still and burst the enemy team. This isn't nessecarily a critique but it does sometimes mean you find yourself in situations you cant save. for example an ulted sven who is invisible stunning you means you are just dead, there is no counter, in 2 hits he will kill you.  The controls need to be reworked, there's too much clutter with the 7 item buttons, 5 ability buttons and buttons for controlling different units for those with summons. For the most part this is unfixable as so many characters like meepo would no longer work but it causes such a large skill gap between 90% of the characters and the few who have multiple summons only for them to be just as balanced as the significantly easier ones.  With the 2 big outliers out the way here's some positives and negatives compared to other MOBAs:  Positive:  + The courier system is genius and so is their way of using teleport scrolls, although I would personally not price teleport scrolls and instead make it a cooldown, otherwise it feels like being punished for good positioning. + The idea of making trees destroyable makes for some interesting moments, you can elevate vision to your liking. + The store is brilliant. Most skins you can earn passively and over 200 hours i spent $8 for a total of 24 skins, as most skins would go for 20 pence on the steam market. + come backs are much easier than league, but lanes are much staler with the lack of a designated jungler who is ganking lanes at all times. You have the option to roam at any time, or go to another lane but you're never encouraged to do it for long other than teamfights at your tower. + The idea of Aghnims shard and sceptre is brilliant and the idea that you can buy a buff to abilities, although i feel like every champion should be incentivised to get at least one, and have the difference between them be at what stage of the game they buy it. for some characters it feels like an actual debuff getting sceptre.  Negatives:  - the ranked system is incredibly predatory, don't even consider trying it. Rank confidence means you must play on a weekly basis for a fair MR each game and the initial placement goes off normal pick MR. if you mostly played turbo like me, grats kid your fucked go to crusader (gold in most games). - Vision is broken. no matter your skill level its too inconsistent as its using light rendering on the assets, which from your camera perspective makes it impossible to guess the sight-lines for. The concept of hiding in the environment is cool, but it just doesn't work here. There's no UI to show if you've been spotted while invisible which means you walk right up to enemies that can see you some times. - The jungle is boring, while i see the need for so many camps for characters like chen to be interesting, it just means the majority of the map is boring. lotuses are a cool idea however because it adds a mini control area for both teams to fight over. - Roshan is boring, hit item is boring. Compared to team buffs like in league it gives your carry the most boring affect possible. - Stats are completely broken. unlike in league where you can easily pick to have more health, or more armour you instead go for items with effects. most of them are boring but also required for a lot of characters, and you're even encouraged to get items with  stats that don't benefit you if it means you get the effect. the only benefit to items in dota is the damage stat, because it means every character gets some value from damage items, meaning carries have more options and don't need to buy e.g. ability power only items.  Overall its got some great additions to MOBA's but there's a lot of outdated ideas in it which need to be reworked.","baik"

"76561199157887199","Hello Ladies and Gents!   The game evokes mixed feelings. On the one hand, there is a large selection of heroes and their abilities, a large selection of weapons, tactics and strategy. On the other hand, any step or action you take that is not esports-related will be perceived as an act of weakness. Any mistakes you make will be ridiculed and spread to you and your family.  Therefore, I recommend just turning off chat and sound notifications, and enjoying the game. Or you can constantly spam -mamkyebal- in a chat, even if you are praised, or written to the wrong person.   Anyway, you must play at least 3-5 games of THIS. And then make a choice. :) ","baik"

"76561198001595249","Dota 2: A Masterclass in Masochism    Ah yes, Dota 2 — the game that truly understands the modern player’s desire to suffer. Why unwind after a long day when you can have your soul slowly crushed over 45-minute matches with strangers who communicate exclusively through pings and slurs?    The learning curve? A gentle vertical wall lined with spikes. You’re not playing a game — you’re attempting a doctorate in pain. And the heroes? With over 120 characters, each with abilities designed to specifically ruin your day, picking the ""wrong"" one guarantees a personal essay in all-chat about your intelligence, ancestry, and life choices.    And let's talk about matchmaking! There's something magical about being paired with a guy named “420NoscopeFeedr” who picks Techies, buys four couriers, and then vanishes into the jungle. Truly, peak competitive balance.    Of course, no Dota 2 experience would be complete without the community. A delightful blend of cryptic philosophers, part-time psychologists, and emotionally unstable warlords. If you're ever feeling too confident or mentally well, just hop into a solo queue match and let the existential dread wash over you.    In conclusion, Dota 2 is perfect — if your idea of fun involves emotional whiplash, aggressive typing, and spending hundreds of hours to improve only slightly before being told to uninstall.    10/10 would cry again.","baik"

I now walk the earth as a husk—emotionally bankrupt, chronically sleep-deprived, and fluent in five dialects of Russian rage.    This isn’t a game. It’s a lifestyle, a second job, a religion, and a prison sentence—all coded into a 50-minute match that you think you're winning until your carry buys a Divine Rapier and dies in front of Roshan at 54:12.    Every match is a fresh trauma. Every teammate is a philosopher-warrior-poet with the emotional stability of a house of cards in a wind tunnel. One day you're a god, last-hitting with surgical precision. The next, you're being reported for existing.    I recommend Dota 2 to anyone who:    Has too much happiness    Wants to understand true hatred    Misses the feeling of betrayal    Wants to yell “MID OR FEED” in a trench coat at 2AM    This game took my time, my peace, my trust in humanity—and I keep coming back, willingly. Why? Because that one perfect Black Hole, that one Rampage, that sweet, sweet victory after 72 minutes of chaos... it makes it all worth it. Briefly.    10/10.

"76561198218938831","**Dota 2** is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve. It’s the spiritual successor to the original *Defense of the Ancients* (DotA), a mod for *Warcraft III*, and it’s one of the most iconic titles in competitive gaming.    Here’s the gist:  - Two teams of **five players** each—Radiant and Dire—battle to destroy the enemy’s **Ancient**, a heavily guarded structure at the heart of their base.  - Each player controls a **hero**, a unique character with distinct abilities and roles. There are over 120 heroes, and no two are quite the same.  - The game unfolds on a single map divided into **three lanes**, with a jungle area in between. Players earn **gold and experience** by defeating enemy units and heroes, which they use to level up and buy powerful items.  - Strategy, timing, and teamwork are everything. A well-timed spell or a clever ambush can turn the tide of battle.    Dota 2 is known for its **steep learning curve**, but also for its **depth and complexity**. It’s a game where every match feels different, and mastery can take years. It also boasts one of the largest esports scenes in the world, with *The International* tournament offering prize pools in the tens of millions.","baik"

"76561199829835316","Few games have shaped the esports landscape as profoundly as Dota 2. Developed by Valve, this free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) stands as a towering giant in competitive gaming—complex, rewarding, and fiercely strategic.    At its core, Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other in a battle to destroy the opposing team’s Ancient, a heavily guarded structure deep within their base. With over a hundred unique heroes, each boasting distinct abilities, playstyles, and roles, no two matches feel the same.    The game balances macromanagement of the battlefield with micromanagement of your hero’s growth—you’ll be farming gold, buying items, coordinating with teammates, ganking enemies, and executing game-changing team fights. It’s a demanding dance of skill, strategy, and split-second decision-making.    Dota 2 is notoriously complex. Its steep learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, but the depth is precisely what has kept the community thriving for years. Every patch introduces balance changes, new items, and sometimes new heroes, ensuring the meta continually evolves.    Mastering one hero, let alone the entire roster, requires time and dedication—but the satisfaction of outplaying an opponent or turning the tide in a crucial moment is unparalleled.    Visually, Dota 2 is colorful and detailed, with each hero uniquely animated and designed to stand out. The maps are richly textured, providing clear tactical information while remaining aesthetically pleasing. Sound design is top-notch, with distinct voice lines, spell effects, and ambient noises contributing to the immersive experience.    With one of the largest esports scenes globally, Dota 2’s The International tournament offers multi-million-dollar prize pools and draws millions of viewers worldwide. The community is passionate, vocal, and dedicated, though the competitive nature can sometimes lead to a steep social environment.    Dota 2 is a monument to strategic depth and player skill—a game that rewards patience, teamwork, and creativity. If you’re willing to invest the time, it offers a rich, endlessly evolving battlefield where every match is a new story.    Complex, competitive, and compelling—Dota 2 remains the pinnacle of MOBA excellence.    Rating: 9/10","baik"

"76561198169132859","When I first jumped into Dota 2, I was completely overwhelmed. I had played other MOBAs before, but Dota 2 felt like a different beast entirely. The depth of the game, the variety of heroes, and the sheer amount of strategies felt daunting. I remember getting wrecked in my early games, and there were moments I seriously considered uninstalling it.  But there’s something about Dota 2 that keeps pulling you back in. It's that perfect blend of strategy, team coordination, and individual skill. Every game feels different. Sure, there are repetitive moments, like the early laning phase or defending against pushers, but no two matches ever play out the same way. Some games you’ll find yourself in an epic comeback, and others, you’ll lose in a crushing defeat, but every single match leaves you with something to learn.  The complexity is a double-edged sword though. At first, it’s kind of like being thrown into the deep end of a pool, and you’re just flailing around trying to stay afloat. But the more you play, the more the game opens up. Mastering last-hitting, understanding item builds, and learning how to actually be a valuable team player (not just a solo god) is incredibly satisfying.  Hero Selection: The best part of the game for me is the hero variety. There’s a hero for every playstyle, and finding your niche feels like discovering an old friend. I went from playing characters that just “clicked” (like Phantom Assassin or Anti-Mage) to appreciating support heroes (like Crystal Maiden or Dazzle), which I never thought I’d enjoy. Being the guy who saves the team with the clutch heal or disable feels pretty damn rewarding.  The game can be ridiculously frustrating though. The learning curve is steep, and it’s easy to get stuck in a cycle of bad games. The community? Yeah, it can be toxic. The in-game chat gets heated, and sometimes it feels like the pressure of winning just makes everyone a little more on edge. That’s definitely one of the downsides, especially when you're just trying to play for fun.  The Esports Scene: As someone who’s not huge into traditional sports, watching The International or any major Dota 2 tournament is a whole different experience. There’s an insane amount of skill on display, and when you see some of the best teams and players coordinate team fights or execute a perfect strategy, it’s like watching art in motion. It’s not just a game at that point, it’s a showcase of the best in the world.  Time Investment: Dota 2 is not a “quick gaming fix.” Some of my most memorable games have lasted over an hour, and every minute feels tense. I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t frustrating to have a match go sideways after investing so much time, but when the game clicks and you have a well-executed victory? It’s one of the most satisfying feelings.  Final Thoughts: At the end of the day, Dota 2 is one of those games that I love to hate and hate to love. I’ve spent hours on it, and while I’ve had my fair share of rage-quitting moments, there’s something that always pulls me back. The depth of strategy, the thrill of learning new heroes, and the satisfaction of improving my gameplay are things that I haven’t found in many other games.  Is it frustrating? Yes. Is it rewarding? Absolutely. Dota 2 is a game that tests you, but if you’re into deep strategy and don’t mind grinding your way through frustration, it’s one of the most satisfying experiences in the gaming world.  Would I recommend it? If you’re willing to commit the time, patience, and mental energy, absolutely. But if you’re just looking for something casual, it might not be the best pick.","baik"

One minute you’re coordinating the perfect teamfight, the next you’re questioning your life choices after a disastrous throw. It’s brutal, it’s punishing, and somehow, it’s still incredibly rewarding. There’s something addictive about the depth of this game — the endless strategies, the hero pool, the meta shifts, the synergy between teammates (or lack thereof). Even when I rage-quit, I find myself queuing up again, chasing that one perfect game. Dota 2 isn’t for everyone. It can be toxic, frustrating, and deeply unforgiving.

"76561198070923073","I played League for years—ranked, normals, ARAM, the whole grind. Thought I understood MOBAs pretty well… then I tried Dota 2.  At first it was overwhelming. The mechanics are brutal: you lose gold when you die, supports don’t get wards for free, and the map control game is way more complex. But once you get past the steep learning curve, Dota feels so much deeper and more rewarding.  Every match feels like a chess game with fireballs. The number of ways to outplay, the freedom in item builds, the map interactions (cutting trees, high ground vision, creep pulling)—it just gives you more tools to turn a losing game around. Comebacks are way more common, and the teamfights are insanely satisfying.  That said, the community can be toxic, the matchmaking isn't always fair, and the game expects a lot from you. It doesn’t hold your hand—but that’s also what makes it amazing.  If you’re coming from LoL and you’re open to re-learning what you thought you knew, Dota 2 might just ruin other MOBAs for you. It did for me.","baik"

"76561199544156886","Started Dota 2 recently — not my first competitive game, but definitely the most *brutal*.    I’ve played tactical shooters and strategy games, but nothing prepared me for the chaos, depth, and emotional rollercoaster that is Dota.    ✔️ The amount of knowledge this game demands is insane — and I *love* that.    ✔️ Every match is a chance to learn, adapt, and evolve.    ✔️ The moment you realize your positioning, item timing, or decision cost the game? That’s where growth begins.    But fair warning:    ❌ The community isn’t always friendly to new players.    ❌ The UI can be overwhelming at first.    ❌ You *will* lose — a lot — and it's part of the process.    🎯 If you have the mindset of a learner, a fighter, and someone who enjoys deep mechanics over instant gratification, Dota 2 might become your new obsession.    I'm not a veteran (yet), but I’m hooked — and I plan to climb, one painful lesson at a time.    💡 P.S. Watch pro replays. Turn on last-hit trainer. Disable all-chat. And embrace the grind.  ","baik"

"76561199272775224","Introduction This game is a beautiful mess. It’s where pure joy and utter chaos live side by side. One minute you're having the chillest co-op session of your life, the next you’re being yelled at in five languages by someone who takes this way too seriously. Still, it's one of the most strangely captivating games out there—especially for someone who doesn’t even consider themselves a “gamer.”  Gameplay: A Rollercoaster of Vibes At its core, this game throws players into team-based matches where synergy, skill, and occasionally blind luck all collide. You can tell the game was designed with love—each character is distinct, every ability feels impactful, and every match tells a different story.  Player Experience: Expect anything from heartwarming teamwork to nuclear-grade toxicity. The matchmaking is a dice roll—you'll either make lifelong friends or need lifelong therapy.  Game Mechanics: Deep but approachable. There’s a satisfying loop of progression, customization, and discovering just how many ways things can go wrong.  Match Flow: Sessions range from short bursts of action to intense drawn-out battles where every decision matters... or doesn’t, depending on your teammates.  Graphics and Sound: Charm Over Realism The visuals strike a great balance—stylized enough to feel timeless, detailed enough to keep things immersive. And the sound? Chef’s kiss. Quirky voice lines, juicy combat effects, and music that kicks in just when things get serious. It’s all part of the personality.  Features and Community  Free-to-Play: Everything you need to win is earned through gameplay. Microtransactions are purely cosmetic and sometimes hilariously over-the-top.  Updates and Content: Regular updates keep things fresh, and community-made content is often just as fun as official releases.  Community Vibe: It’s... mixed. Some players are saints, others are chaos gremlins. Mute buttons exist for a reason.  Pros:  Endless replay value and character variety.  Surprisingly deep for a game that sometimes feels like a party simulator.  Community creativity and dev support keep it alive and well.  No pay-to-win nonsense.  Cons: – Wildly inconsistent player behavior. – Learning curve if you're new to this type of game. – Occasional bugs and balance issues.  Conclusion This game is a hilarious contradiction: accessible yet deep, fun yet infuriating, casual-friendly yet ultra-competitive. Whether you're in it for the memes, the mechanics, or just to see what all the fuss is about—there’s something here that pulls you in. If you can stomach the occasional chaos (and maybe install a chat filter), it’s a 10/10 ride. Just... don’t take it too seriously, or it might consume your soul.","baik"

"76561198839750974","As someone who's been playing Dota 2 for a while now, I can confidently say that this game is an incredibly well-crafted experience. Coming from several years of playing League of Legends, I was already familiar with the MOBA genre—but Dota 2 is a whole different beast.    What stands out immediately is how much depth and complexity this game has. The mechanics are challenging yet rewarding, the heroes are diverse and uniquely designed, and the visual style is polished and immersive. Compared to LoL, which focuses more on fast-paced action and quicker matches, Dota 2 emphasizes patience, timing, and strategic planning. Every decision you make, every item you buy, and every move you execute can turn the tide of the game.    Even with prior MOBA experience, I had to relearn many things. Dota 2 introduces a different rhythm and philosophy, and that’s exactly what makes it so enjoyable. It constantly pushes you to think, adapt, and grow as a player. It’s not just a game—it’s a challenge, and I love that about it.    I highly recommend Dota 2 to anyone who enjoys competitive gameplay, rich mechanics, and strategic depth. Whether you're new to MOBAs or transitioning from another title like LoL, Dota 2 offers a fresh, exciting, and incredibly engaging experience.    10/10 – Truly impressive.","baik"

"76561198067243735","Dota is not just a game. It’s a mirror of real life. It teaches you things you didn’t even sign up to learn. In my case, I learned a lot about domestic violence and the judicial system.  The other day I was playing offlane Axe (Archon 1) against a Lifestealer (Ancient 2) and his pos 5 Lion (Ancient 4). I went full lane-cut.   Lifestealer tried to adapt by dragging his creep wave to meet mine behind his tower, trying to deny me my cut. He fought back valiantly. But sadly, the system favoured me. Every time he resisted, my Axe spun. Eventually, he had to back off. He lost the lane. And soon, he lost everything.  By 8 minutes, I had a Vanguard, full Magic Wand, Brown Boots, and a Blink Dagger. I was unstoppable. I took his Tier 1 tower and shoved the wave in so hard it hit his Tier 2. Then I left the lane to go gank mid.  And that’s when I realised - I felt like a divorced woman.  Before I walked away from the lane (the relationship), I made sure to take his house (his tower), his money (the creepwave), and ensured he’d never see the kids again (my allied creeps). I left him broke and homeless, farming jungle camps like a man forced to move back in with his mother.  I didn’t see him again for most of the game. Well, okay, I did - but then I culled him with the fury of a woman’s rights, and back to the jungle he went. I think I low-key made him lose his sanity.  My job? To make sure he doesn’t touch the creepwave. Every time he tried to sneak in some farm, I felt like I was forced to police the situation - to make sure he didn’t do anything inappropriate to the “kids.”   As time went on, you could see it. His will to continue, his morale - it dipped hard. I think I broke him. I stripped him of his identity as a carry (and as a man).   His team, (his family and friends), started blaming him for failing in his duties. And I didn’t even need to spread any rumors. Just let the silence sink in.  Needless to say, I was also MVP that game. It felt so easy. Like a decade ago, I wouldn't be able to pull this off. But now, with women's right (the latest patch and META) and everything, ruining a man's day (or a carry) has never been easier than before.  But when I lose my offlane? It feels like going through the worst kind of domestic abuse. Give the carry an inch, and he’ll beat the living soul out of you. Again and again. No mercy. No way out.  So yeah. That’s Dota 2.  A harsh, brutal, and strangely accurate reflection of life.  10/10. Will play again soon.","baik"

"76561198197957349","Most of the reviews on the game are jokes about either addiction or its less than stellar community, but here's a more honest one to break it up.    I recently got back into Dota 2 after playing it a bit many years ago, when I saw some live esports matches on YouTube, ESL Dota 2 does some great coverage of it. I didn't understand much of what they were saying but I decided to give it a try because it looked cool.    Dota 2 is the kind of game where you need to do at least a bit of research and have a good amount of practice and knowledge about how the game is played and what the proper practices are to not only be good at it but also to not make your teammates mad. It doesn't take a masters degree of knowledge to play it casually like I do, so playing a couple of offline bot matches and utilizing the very useful hero demo mode should help you out in that regard, it won't make you a pro but it'll give you a decent idea of how the game should be played. I highly recommend trying out Dragon Knight first as he's a good example of how the different types of hero abilities in the game function, He's my favorite since he was the character you were given in the old tutorial that the game had when I first played it long ago. Should you stick with him for online matches? Probably not, but he'll help you get your bearings.    I don't know much about the online side of the game since so far I've only played offline matches with bots as of recently, I did play a few online matches years ago but I was pretty young and didn't know much about how the game worked. When I was researching on Reddit, players were saying that the offline mode bots were busted, and after playing a few matches I can understand why they'd think that, they do have some weird behavior, but the bots aren't to the point where they can't play the game or stop you from playing it, far from it. The offline mode is a great way to play the game without out any potential spoilsports ruining the vibe, just make sure you set it to solo and not co-op, unless you've got a group of friends willing to join you against the bots.    It's also of note that the game runs decently well on lower end systems like my 2018 mid range laptop which seems more like a potato nowadays, as long as you're willing to turn off a lot of the fancy graphics settings, also it's one of the only competitive online games to support Linux out of the box, along with the low low price of $0, it's a great deal for people looking for a RTS adjacent game that doesn't require as much management to preform decently at it.    Hope this helps you out, happy trails! - VentureMan","baik"

Even if over the last few years the skins have made glance value less consistent, everything is clear and crisp.   However,  I have noticed a sharp increase of absolute psychopathic bastards with the thinnest skins humanly possible. I've had people feed, deliberately not use their spells/items or just jungle at the tiniest criticism or something not going absolutely perfect. Every single game, whether it is unranked or ranked, I've felt like I needed a degree in psychology just to ensure that the worst manbabies play the game.

"76561199226506919","People usually compare DOTA to abusive relationships: you kind of unintentionally know and understand  that it has to finish sooner or later, but it is so comforting, addictive, and “adrenaliny” that even those who have courage to end (delete) it, usually come back after some time for that “high” (I absolutely hate and absolutely love you) feeling.   For me, DOTA is more like a therapy: when im in the darkest state of mind, when I experience trauma in life, or when I am simply frustrated, I always return to DOTA for that “time travel until better days” kind of vibe.   DOTA helps me relax by being a very engaging, focus, strategy, and right-decision-oriented game where I feel needed and useful (especially when I miss these feelings in real life).

"76561199026340019","The perfect game if you’ve ever thought, “I want to be emotionally devastated by strangers from around the world in under 40 minutes.” It’s not just a game — it’s a lifestyle of regret, rage, and reinstalling.    The tutorial? Oh, you mean that vague memory from 2013? Don’t worry, you’ll learn everything you need to know when a guy named “420SniperMain” screams at you in all chat because you didn’t stack at precisely 53.75 seconds.    Let’s not forget the matchmaker, which appears to operate on the principle of chaos theory. Sometimes you get matched with a pro. Other times, you get someone who just discovered their mouse has two buttons. Spice of life!    And the gameplay — absolutely thrilling. Nothing quite compares to the joy of carrying your entire team for 50 minutes, only to lose because someone thought it’d be a great time to try out a new build. On ranked. With Techies.    Graphics? Stunning. Especially when you’re lying dead for 110 seconds wondering why you came back to this game again.    Would I recommend it?

Every match is different. You have to think ahead, adapt to your enemies, and communicate with your team. Whether you're drafting heroes, making split-second decisions in fights, or managing resources, Dota 2 pushes you to think smart and act fast.    Yes, it has a steep learning curve, but once you start to understand the mechanics and strategies, it becomes incredibly rewarding. The feeling of outplaying your opponents or turning the game around with teamwork and good calls is unmatched.    If you're someone who enjoys strategy, competition, and personal growth, I highly recommend giving Dota 2 a try.

"76561198036344226","Ah, Dota 2 — the game that takes five minutes to learn and approximately a decade to tolerate. Valve’s free-to-play masterpiece is less of a game and more of a psychological experiment to see how long humans can endure emotional trauma in 45-minute intervals.    The gameplay? Elegant chaos. You and four random strangers — who you will grow to hate more than your high school group project partners — attempt to coordinate strategy, map control, and hero synergy. Instead, you’ll likely witness jungle farming while your base burns, a “mid or feed” lunatic, and someone typing in Cyrillic who may or may not be summoning a demon.    The community is legendary — not in the wholesome way, but more in the “if Dante wrote a gaming chapter in Inferno” way. You haven’t truly gamed until a Peruvian support player blames your mom for missing a last hit. It's the only game where your IQ drops every time you open team chat, and every “GG” could mean “good game” or “I hope your router catches fire.”    The graphics are beautiful, the mechanics are razor-sharp, and the learning curve is so steep it legally qualifies as a cliff. Every hero has 4 spells, 32 counters, and at least one skin that looks like it belongs in a discount cosplay convention.    And the best part? You’ll be back. Oh yes, you’ll uninstall it, swear off it, maybe touch grass… and then one day, you’ll see a patch note like “Wraith King now has a scepter upgrade that lets him haunt your dreams,” and you’ll be reinstalling faster than Pudge can miss a hook.","baik"

Every match is a new adventure: maybe I’ll dominate as Pudge, or maybe I’ll spend 60 minutes being yelled at in Russian while my teammates farm jungle camps like they owe them money. Either way, I'm having the time of my life.  The heroes? Beautifully designed. The mechanics? Impossibly deep. The learning curve? A vertical cliff with barbed wire and fire at the top, but my god do I love the climb.  Sometimes I win. Sometimes I lose. Sometimes I accidentally pick Techies and get reported by my own friends.

A shiny Archon badge that mocks me every time I log in.  Let's start with the good, shall we? The depth of strategy in this game is unparalleled. With over 100 heroes, each with unique abilities, and a dizzying array of items, the possibilities are endless. Every match feels like a new puzzle to solve, a fresh challenge to overcome. The thrill of a well-executed team fight or a game-winning play? Pure dopamine.  But oh boy, the frustration. You'd think after nearly 7,700 hours, I'd be sitting pretty in the Divine ranks, right? WRONG. I'm still duking it out in the trenches of Archon and Legend, wondering if I'll ever see the promised land of Ancient. It's like being stuck in a time loop, but instead of Groundhog Day, it's Grounds for Uninstalling Day... except I never do.  The community? A mixed bag of wholesome teammates who restore your faith in humanity, and toxic players who make you question why you even bother. It's like a social experiment gone wrong, but somehow, I keep coming back for more.  And let's not forget the patches. Just when you think you've got the meta figured out, BAM! IceFrog drops a new update that turns everything on its head. Suddenly, your favorite hero is trash, and that hero you never touched is the new hotness. It's exciting and infuriating in equal measure.  Yet, despite all the rage quits, the ""cyka blyat"" spam, and the crushing defeats, there's something magical about Dota 2 that keeps pulling me back in. Maybe it's the hope that the next game will be THE game where everything clicks. Or perhaps I'm just a glutton for punishment.  So here I am, 7,670.9 hours deep, still chasing that Ancient dream. Will I ever get there? Who knows. But one thing's for sure - I'll be spending another 7,000 hours trying.  If you value your social life, your sleep schedule, or your sanity, stay far, far away from Dota 2.

Doing Overwatch cases (you act as a judge) and seeing all the ways in which people willingly disrupt games and win chances makes you question the very fabric of human beings (or at least those addicted to this game). Stay away at all costs.","buruk"
"76561198022256662","This game is awful, its toxic, the skill floor of this game is a mountain cliff, and the skill ceiling is infinite. I've played this game for 11k hours and i've never actually learned how to play it because i've only played support.  It's overly complicated, it's the game that is affected by skill inflation the most, its ruthless, its insanely toxic, and i regret every second i wasted on this game. No matter how much Valve tries to ease the skill floor with a bunch of QoL such as showing wards vision range or showing crowd control bars on enemies, this game will always be dota, and dota is for people that hate themselves and brings the worst in people.  If you are a new player, this game is impenetrable. Expect to lose the game in 15 minutes, and wait another 30 minutes by watching your base slowly crumpling, and getting fountain farmed to oblivion.  it's not fun to stomp, its not fun to get stomped, and it has e-sports mentality all over it, it is the most tryhard game in the market, Stay the heck away from this ruthless sweatland game.

"76561198064407495","The higher u go the more account buyers and account boost buyers you encounter. They don't even try to hide it since Valve doesn't care.  Valve likes money and if a person is willing to swipe for an account/account boost they are most likely going to be willing to sub to DotA+ and buy skins.  DotA+ is another very big bait in my opinion depending on what you're buying it for. I bought it only for the predicted match quality and the ability to avoid people. Most of the games that had ""Ideal"" predicted match quality ended up in a hard one-sided stomp.  The game itself is amazing but it has become cancer to play due to an insane amount of people playing the game at a certain rank who do not belong there and just waste everybody else's time.  Do not get addicted like myself, skip until Valve decides to give real people jobs to deal with acc buyers/acc boost buyers and not rely on their community to identify them while wasting their time playing with the same people.","buruk"

"76561198120223786","Negative Review of Dota 2    Dota 2 is one of the most overrated and toxic games I have ever encountered. Despite years of existence and Valve’s enormous resources, the game remains incredibly frustrating, mentally exhausting, and often unfair in every possible way.    1. Terrible Community  One of the main reasons people quit Dota 2 is its community. It is truly toxic: in almost every game, there is at least one player who either deliberately ruins the match or insults the entire team. The report system is practically useless—griefers and toxic players go unpunished, while you can get muted just for asking your team to play cooperatively.    2. Extremely High Learning Curve  Even if you want to learn the game, are willing to invest time, and try to understand the mechanics, Dota 2 doesn’t make it easy for you. There is no proper tutorial, and the sheer amount of information you need to memorize is overwhelming. Moreover, even if you become a skilled player, that doesn’t mean you’ll win—too much depends on teammates and pure luck.    3. Balance is a Myth  Heroes are either too strong or completely useless. Every patch shifts the meta so drastically that you have to relearn everything. Some heroes stay unplayable for months, making it pointless to invest time mastering them, as they may become irrelevant in just a couple of updates.    4. Matchmaking is a Lottery  The ranking system in Dota 2 is another source of frustration. Matchmaking works in such a way that sometimes you get a team that plays perfectly, and sometimes you get players who have no understanding of the game’s basics. There is no balance between teams, and your wins or losses are more dependent on luck than skill.    5. A Waste of Time  To make any real progress, you need to invest hundreds of hours, yet even after that, you won’t necessarily enjoy the game. Every match is either stressful or disappointing, and the feeling of satisfaction is extremely rare.    Conclusion  Dota 2 may seem interesting at first, but in reality, it drains your time, nerves, and energy. It is a game for those who are willing to endure toxicity, unbalanced mechanics, and frustration. If you’re looking for fun, it’s best to stay far away from this chaos.","buruk"

"76561198047333591","Impressions are purely based on nearly 200 unranked games, but by god is Dota 2 one brilliant video game with one incompetent developer and millions of players who don't deserve access to anything made after 19th century.  I wish I could enjoy it because the actual game part is brilliant. It quite the first of its kind, but it definitely defined and popularized it, and it's easy to see why. They took the fun of hero characters in RTS games, amplified it tenfold, and then built a whole game around it. Every match you have a lot of decisions to make that vary drastically based on the state of the game, team compositions, economy, individual player builds and playstyles, etc. Even the characters themselves are so diverse, and I think this is the biggest leg up it has over the competition. Gameplay itself can shift so much from character to character that it's almost understandable why some sickos pick one flavor and the eat nothing but that for thousands of hours.  It's also an almost paradoxical game where both hero and system overall enable a great amount of skill expression, yet proper teamwork and coordination are still important to an extent that you rarely actually see in team based multiplayer games. It's also one game where ""nobody is broken when everyone is"" really does feel accurate. In the right hands and with the right items, pretty much every character can do things that will make you think ""well, that's some bull****,"" yet there is often a powerful counter to it, a way to play around it, or something equally bull that every other character can pull off. Dota 2 *feels* loose in every element of its design, yet when you look closer at any of those elements, you start seeing thin but unbreakable connection that weave the fabric that Dota is made of.  Even in terms of visuals and storytelling I like more about it than I would expect from a MOBA. There's a lot of lore to explore, and while much of it is lacking, and Valve is sort of just sitting on it, it feels like whoever is responsible for putting it all together still cares deeply about the universe that this game is set it, and Crownfall is hopefully first of many examples of what can be done with it.   The only caveat here is that Valve also has some of the soulless, greediest monetization practices, and very low standards for maintaining the visual integrity of the games they created. All the fine craftsmanship that was put into creating the art style of TF2 was smeared with crap once lootbox money started rolling in. CS mostly resisted this, because cosmetics used to be limited to only weapons, but Dota 2 art style also went down the drain. Anything is permitted, and the more offensively tasteless it looks, the more rare and expensive it is.   The base characters all have their charm in some way. I understand that they aren't to everyone's taste. Many of them lack maybe one or two features that would make them feel like a ""main character,"" which is something that I feel a lot of hero based games chase after. All of them are just a bit too plain or simple to fit that role. You have dozens of dudes in armor of various colors and sizes, but it weirdly appeals to me that no individual character feels too ""special"" I guess?   That was all thrown out the moment Valve smelled money. Now you can spend an unreasonable amount of money in order to turn your unremarkable mook into a high level MU Online whale. It's funny because Valve still has those brilliant cosmetics guidelines for people who want to make something, but they haven't cares about what is said there for years. Silhouettes? Who cares. Glance value? Dude, just remember that this pile of pixels is Sniper. The arcanas are especially offensive, because they advertise extra crap as a selling point. Most Dota 2 chars emit zero lights or particles, some sets will give you clouds, glowing gems, arcs of lightning, buzzling flies or orbiting stars, excess is the goal over something coherent or appealing, and the community happily eats it up. Perhaps they don't even care about the look, since all of this is connected to the real money marketplace that enables gambling addicts, whales, and kids who think they can make money by playing their favorite video game.  Anyway, Valve happily enabling gambling aside, one of the main things that makes this game harder to enjoy is the quality of matchmaking and moderation. I have a succesful griefing report for pretty much every single day that I played, and to give you an idea, that doesn't even include a case where we had a willow that stood AFK in the fountain and sent our her courier to die, I guess that didn't count or something. Griefers would be one thing, but there's also so many accounts that are merely days old but obviously aren't remotely new to Dota. If it all it takes to avoid smurf que is to occasionally throw a game, then I'm not sure Valve understands the point of smurf que. Finally even ignoring these two points that already ruin 90% of my matches, the game loves to put new and old players together. I don't care if MMR is similar, a Zeus with 12k wins will be stronger than (non-smurfing) Zeus qith 20 games under their belt, it makes no sense to not take player count into account.  Maybe ranked would've resolved some of my woes, but you need 100 in-game hours to even gain access to that. It took me well over 150 matches to get to that point. I'm not sure if Dota players understand this, but the point of ranked isn't just to stroke your ego and to achieve the highest number/icon possible. It's there to enable fair matches between equally matched opponents. If someone is new and bad, they will be put up against other new and bad players, that's good.  ""But it keeps smurfs out"" please reconsider even attempting to think that this makes sense. More dedicated smurfs are buying accounts and paying boosters to get whatever they want, Valve is exceptionally bad at handling that too. More stingy ones are then thrown into unranked with players who could've been playing ranked, and I'm not sure too many of them are willing to endure low quality matches for 100 hours before they are allowed to experience something more tolerable. It's really a shame. Under more caring developer, Dota 2 could've been a fantastic experience.","buruk"

This game to me is like licking the bottom of a shoe that's been through mud, dirt, shit, and dead corpses.  I cannot fathom why the urge to install this shitty game is so strong within my soul. The draw to this piece of shit is unlike anything I've felt in this life. Nothing can compare to the shear dread and misery that becomes of my soul when I click that green play button. Every game, even the ones I win, are pure dogshit and fuckage. The absolute depression that falls upon me when the enemy shits on me at every turn is maddening. The only feeling of ecstasy this game brings to me is when the enemy pushes my Ancient and ends the game, and thus, my suffering. The Fact I have spent a total of 66 full days of my life in this shithole is a testament to my ability to control my impulses. I can never recommend this game to anyone unless they want to spend hours upon hours of their dick getting stepped on with cleats. Pure and utter misery, beginning to end.

"76561198030958834","A lifelong gamer since the Atari, however, Dota2 would be the first MOBA I've played...very late to the genre, I am. My first 9 games with bots I got MVP each time, increasing the difficulties as I progressed, exploring the different roles. After feeling quite successful I decided I need to play with other players if I am to get better, as playing with bots got  a little boring. I bought some skins too!!   My first match with players against bots, a player on the team had 82 kills!!! He killed so much so fast no one could keep up and it was quite annoying, this player with over 1000 hours in the game has sucked the fun out but whatever, it's only one match....  My second match wasn't much better so I decided to just go unranked pvp matches...every match I played I was thoroughly destroyed, camped at my spawn point, spawn, die, repeat.... every match lasts almost an hour.   When i look at my opponents they have 5k hours in this game, it's incredibly unbalanced matchmaking.  Every match I played was against people with 100's-1000's more hours than me. After watching videos on youtube and going back to playing against bots until I learn all the hero's and their abilities, I realized I would need to invest a hardcore amount of time to even be decent but the misery and frustration that would required to git gud just isn't worth my time.

"76561198027808762","This guy is spot on. He only has 15k hours because he fell into the trap like countless others and many more will in the future.  The game is literally designed to create addiction and fuel their monthly battle pass subscription service. Hackers run rampant and if you somehow overcome the odds and begin to win, the game studies you, adapts, and then overcomes you.  How does it overcome you? Many ways, let's name a few: Opponents cheat, your team are bots, you play on ""North America"" server but all your team are from foreign lands speaking everything but English, your team are toxic/griefers, the mmr is hidden and pairs you with wide ""skill"" gap teammates vs Seal Team 6.  Let's examine some red flags: The worst and best players in dota vary in winrate from 46 percent to 54 percent until you hit your ""true"" mmr!  Watch people use their ""mmr"" as some kind of badge or medal defining their worth while seamlessly making plays worse than any ""Herald"" low rank player you've ever seen. Be a scientist and run an experiment: Spend money and watch your ""winrate"" suddenly go up!  Still not convinced? Watch your favorite streamers get secret algorithm boosts from the developers so they can ""win"" but we all know if they were in the matches you face on your account, even the ""pros"" couldn't win. Doubt me? Tell me how you win when your team runs down middle and feeds as soon as they respawn because you didn't play the way ""they want"" or because they lost their last game and now you must suffer 2 or you defeated them in the previous game and now they will make sure you lose.  Let's find a solution! Simply put them on your avoid list right? But wait! You are limited on the amount of ""avoid"" slots even with the subscription service.  How about mute your team? Enjoy playing a ""team game"" requiring communication on silent mode.  How about communicate with your team? Watch them mute you faster than you can say ""Cash or Credit.""   ""Free To Play"" has and always will be a keyword for ""Pay To Win"" and ""Hackers Paradise"".  Even ""pro teams"" can't beat ""AI"" artificial intelligence.  Look up ""Open AI defeats OG"" on youtube from 6 years ago for any ""haters"" or ""doubters"" of what I'm saying. Better yet, look up ""Dota 2 Tips hackers"" and you will find a plethora of dota 2 cheats and cheaters.  For the longest time people ran with the mantle of ""hacks don't exist"" in dota or ""it's about skill"" while they ""360 headshot"" you and laugh. Anyone still remember ""Liver King Claims To Be Natty""? Or how about Clintons ""I did not sleep with that woman! Ms. Lewinski!"".  The developers don't care about any of us, simply about making money. The game was never about skill or any other ""keywords"" they use to trigger you with. It was and always will be simply a source of endless revenue for a company ""Valve"" that simply doesn't care but they can and will keep you coming back because ""things are different now"".  They know we can't stop them and they can and will continue to treat us like the cash cows we are. This game owes you nothing but they can and will steal everything from you if you let them.  When you get called an idiot in dota or any other game just take a deep breathe and imagine the anonymous idiot behind a computer screen being a keyboard warrior with his paid actor ""friends"" ganging up on you because they don't want to be the next target.  One look at your President of Valve Corporation ""Lord Gaben"" or his ""net worth"" should tell you all you need to know about ""Valve"" and their so called ""ethics"".  If you get on his nice list maybe he will even give you an ""Immortal"" high rank account for free so you 2 can look and act like a ""pro"" 2.  If you read nothing else just do this: Find a guy/girl you like and tell them how important a video game called ""Dota 2"" is to you and how much time you've ""invested"".

But when you merged solo and party MMR, it led to rank boosting through parties or account selling. Now the game is full of boosters, buyers, and smurfs. Sometimes, I encounter bugs, and while everyone else exploits them, when I try, my teammates throw the game because they want to be heroes and play fair. But when I stop using bugs, the enemy team does. Immortal MMR has become inflated, and unless you separate solo and party ranked play, you can't fix it.

"76561199261524308","I used to love this game, I've been playing since the original DOTA (on Warcraft 3 [Custom Game]). However, recently the game has become substantially worse, rife with toxic behavior from people who believe they know how to play the game, but unfortunately do not. Recently, I've had people curse me out calling me every name under the sun, simply for correcting them about a mistake they made with regards to the rules of making a report, or how the game is traditionally played. Sometimes the players will just shut down completely, (I'm being cordial and kind the entire time, mind you.) so they start talking over me every time I try to talk, not letting me get a word in edgewise. At that point I may simply call them a ""noob"" they report me and then somehow I get my behavior score lowered, even though they were the one harassing me and going utterly ballistic in the first place. I find this to be completely ridiculous. Most people cannot take constructive criticism or advice in this game, they almost ALWAYS take it personally. Also, there are some EXTREME imbalances in the game, where characters such as Warlock, Windranger, and Juggernaught can simply plow through nearly an entire team by themselves, due to their outrageously overpowered ultimate abilities. This game needs some SERIOUS reworking.  As if all of that wasn't bad enough, There is a disconnect on nearly 2/3 games now, meaning you typically have to start at least 3 different games just to get one that you may be actually be able to play through to the finish, without someone disconnecting. I've even disconnected several times myself, and I know that it's not my internet causing the issue because I haven't disconnected from the internet at all. This has become a constant. I used to be able to recommend this game, but I certainly no longer can for these reasons.","buruk"

"76561198035064386","As a long-time Dota 2 player since 2013, I’ve witnessed the game evolve—but not always for the better. While the core gameplay remains engaging, Valve’s approach to matchmaking and MMR has become increasingly frustrating, to the point where it feels like the system is actively working against you rather than facilitating fair competition.  -The biggest issue with Dota 2’s ranked system is its apparent forced 50% win rate mechanic. No matter how well you play, the game seems determined to keep you at a certain MMR range by stacking the odds against you, even if you’re a positive player, the game will punish you by pairing you with toxic teammates or griefers if your Behavior Score drops slightly, making climbing nearly impossible, OR  after a few wins, the system will almost always match you against significantly stronger opponents or give you weaker teammates to ""balance"" your progress.  - I mean back in the day, ranking up felt rewarding. Now, it feels like the system is deliberately slowing your progress to keep you playing longer, because of smurfs and boosters ruining games or due to role queue exploits!  - If you’ve been playing since 2013 (like me), you’ve probably noticed that Dota 2 doesn’t reward experience. Even if you take a short break, the game seems to ""forget"" your skill level, placing you in worse matches until you ""prove yourself"" again. The low to mid-tier ranks (Crusander to Legend) are where the worst matchmaking occurs—filled with boosted accounts, griefers, and players who don’t care about winning.  - So, to conclude, if you’ve been stuck in the same rank for years despite improving, it’s not (just) your fault—the system is designed this way. Dota 2’s matchmaking doesn’t prioritize fair games it prioritizes engagement, keeping you grinding endlessly. Unless Valve makes drastic changes, the cycle of frustration will continue, making the game feel more like a chore than a rewarding experience. If you’re tired of the grind, the best solution might be to step away—because Dota 2 clearly doesn’t respect your time 👿","buruk"

This cycle of alternating between favorable and frustrating matchups feels manipulative and disheartening.

"76561198856182653","[h1]Dota 2 – A Brutal Lesson in Frustration (from a LoL Veteran)[/h1]  With over 4000 hours in League of Legends, I thought I’d seen it all in the MOBA world. I expected Dota 2 to be hard, deep, maybe even rewarding in time. Instead, I found a game that actively hates new players.  [h2] Hero Design – Welcome to the Stun-Lock Hell[/h2] Dota 2 doesn’t teach you. It punishes you. • Enemies strike from fog with absurd range. • You're stunned before you see them. • You're deleted before you can blink. • There’s no counterplay, no outplay, no escape.  This isn't a learning curve – it’s a spike through your skull.  [h2] Thrown Into the Fire, Alone[/h2] I requested a coach. No one came. There’s no tutorial that actually helps. No guidance. No mentoring. You're tossed into matches with veterans who will tear you apart, and if you ask for help? Expect pings, flames, or silence.  Dota 2 doesn’t care if you’re learning. It just wants you to suffer or quit.  [h2] The Item System – Designed to Confuse, Not Enhance[/h2] • Active items with no visual clarity • Courier juggling like it’s StarCraft • Recipes that make zero sense • Mandatory outside research just to function  I spent more time alt-tabbing to Wikis than actually playing the game. At some point I asked myself: Is this even fun anymore?  [h2] Chaos Disguised as Depth[/h2] Early game? Slow and punishing. Mid game? Fog ganks and surprise deaths. Late game? Blink in, die instantly, stare at death screen.  I didn’t get better. I got numb and I couldn’t learn from my mistakes because I didn’t even understand what killed me.  It’s not ""deep gameplay."" It’s opaque and abusive game design.  [h2] Community – Gatekeeping on Steroids[/h2] • Ask a question? Get mocked. • Die once? ""Report noob."" • Try to play safe? ""Why u no help?""  This isn't a community. It's a fortress of elitism, and if you’re not already inside, you're just cannon fodder.","buruk"

"76561198414383861","Dota 2: A Descent into Digital Hell    If you're looking for a game that will push you to the brink of insanity, look no further than Dota 2. This digital cesspool is a toxic wasteland where the only thing more frustrating than the gameplay is the community.    The matchmaking is a broken mess, pairing seasoned veterans with absolute noobs. It's like trying to teach a toddler how to play chess while a grandmaster watches. The heroes are so overpowered or underpowered that it feels like a rigged casino. And don't even get me started on the balance changes. They're so frequent and unpredictable that it's like trying to hit a moving target in a hurricane.    But the real horror lies in the community. Every game is a verbal battleground, filled with insults, threats, and a constant barrage of flaming. It's like being trapped in a toxic wasteland with a bunch of angry monkeys. And if you're lucky enough to escape a game without being verbally abused, you'll probably be reported for ""abandoning"" the match.    The toxicity doesn't stop at the verbal abuse. The in-game chat is filled with spam, advertising, and people trying to sell you items for real money. And if you're unlucky enough to encounter a hacker, your game is pretty much over.    The only thing worse than the game itself is the people who play it. Avoid this toxic cesspool at all costs. Unless you enjoy being verbally abused, having your mental health destroyed, and wasting your life on a game that's not worth playing.  ","buruk"

"76561198018347508","I came back to Dota after years and I can't believe what you've done to it. I search for ranked matches in West EU. Literally in every game more than half of the players are from countries other than West EU. Everywhere is full of Russians or Ukrainians. They shout into the voice chat in their own language. They flood the chat text with meaningless characters that no one understands. There's nothing you can do about it. As soon as you politely ask these monkeys for English, that they play in Western Europe, you get even more Russian and Ukrainian as an answer. This is not fun, friends. It really is not. The only option is to mute everyone, but then I can go play any singleplayer and I'll have the same experience. I can't play on more Western servers because of the ping.  I absolutely don't understand why I can't ban heroes in ranked games. The game itself bans heroes completely randomly. What's the point of that?  There is no system in the game to give up a game you've already lost. For example, in a game where everyone is yelling at each other in Ukrainian and Russian. In a game where the pick fails and in the 10th minute the score is 0:20 and it is clear to everyone that it is a loss. In such games you make the players suffer another 20-50 minutes. For leaving earlier and saving nerves and mental health you penalize. Because you don't want the players to have fun. You want them to suffer until the last second. This is not fun, friends. It really is not.  There are many similar games like your Dota on the market. Just get inspired by others. Take the best from them. What you are missing. And for God's sake implement it. You have been working on the game for 12 years and it really doesn't look like that.  In its current state, Dota is almost unplayable. It has nothing to do with fun.","buruk"

"76561198843180031","Is Dota a good game? Potentially yes, it seems fun, well crafted... but there are glaring issues. You have created a system where there is an elitist group of players in every match that will simply beat less experienced players, and putting BRAND new players into those lobbies. Most other games of this genre and generally for every game, will not in fact put BRAND new players against players with 4k+ matches played? There is a clear disadvantage there, even if you play all the tutorial and try AI games. Language and terms are not matched, knowledge of items and the game not there.   Why in the world is this game so beloved? Because the past generation continues to play and upkeeps it, but it is awful. The community is unhelpful and toxic, not in the sense of slurs or insults but rather that they are so unwilling to help and simply flame new players and then make fun of their mistakes instead of doing ANYTHING useful. Whilst not outwardly toxic, this is one of the least fun, most dislikeable communities I've ever seen. I hated every second playing it and I will never do so again and to ANYONE out there starting out, I'd recommend you do the same.

"76561199817761730","Доброго времени суток уважаемые игроки Dota 2. Нет желания кому-то доказывать, или оправдывать чье-либо мнение. Комментарий сугубо больше для себя для закрепления опыта в данной сфере. В игре будучи с 2025 года и 15 января, я наиграла более 1000 матчей, подняв 1700+ ммр в рейтинге (большая часть в Allpick). За все это время в доте можно ощутить и увидеть весь спектр эмоций, большая часть из которых негативная. Придя сюда увлеченной игрой с человеком и после игры без него, дота не принесла ничего кроме негативных и пустых эмоций. Игра пустая с однообразным геймплеем и тратой времени более чем на час, а бывало и полтора. Ради чего? Ради 25 ПТС. В доте я была активным и достаточно порядочным игроком чтобы оставаться в тени наблюдателем. Люди последними грязными словами кроют в этой игре, желают смерти, кидают угрозы. Те кто имеет другой ранг дабы самоутвердиться готовы низко пасть чтобы удовлетворить свою неполноценность. Люди растеряли свою честь в компьютерной игре, и с пенной у рта готовы грызть друг друга. И вся дота как посев надежды, лотерея. Большая часть игроков никогда не станет известными или не будет участвовать в больших играх, фигурируя как известные крутые команды и тп, они застрянут на своем рейтинге 2к и не сдвинутся. Для игроков это не просто уже способ побега от реальности, а способ укрыться и скоротать время. Но годы идут, мы взрослеем и отдаем лучшие годы впустую. Можно вставить 5 копеек и сказать - Не все такие! Я играю в меру!. Конечно! Мера - есть, но не все ее соблюдают.   Я не рекомендую сюда заходить игрокам которых интересует нормальный геймплей, сугубо сосредоточенный на игре, а не на личностях что смеют оскорблять, ведь даже если таким людям дать ответ они его не поймут. Другой сорт. Моей руки больше в игре этой не будет. Удачи людям в игровом мире. Игры приносят пользу, и иногда даже помогают, но они также могут нанести и вред, если ты далеко в них заходишь.","buruk"
"76561198084539624","This game is a combination of urine and shit, every time you enter this game, the developers plunge you into a degrading society with the addition of Russians (garbage) who are dumber than dogs, because even a dog can be taught to carry out commands from superior intelligence, but Russians are the garbage of our world that is so flawed and weak that it feeds on imposing its inferiority and weakness on everyone else.

"76561198013184567","You should go play a game that does not rely on communicating with Mr. Russia and Mr. China, or attempting to shepherd clinical cases of tunnelvision and kamikaze behaviour towards a very slim chance at victory.     The actual game mechanics are defined by a very short time to kill and a lot of crowd control (stun, fear, silence, etc.). This offers depth and opportunities for teamplay, even if I personally think time to kill is too short. However, this means that it is even more important to communicate with people who just do not want to. Ultimately, Dota 2 is ruined by a complete disconnect between the game mechanics and the community it  spawned.     This is a frustration and grief simulator with only one promise: it will waste your time.    Don't pick up this game in 2025 or beyond - it's not worth it.","buruk"

"76561198042292732","I've played dota on and off for almost 20 years. In my opinion it is the greatest game of all time. Over the years there has been few things in my life that itch like dota. Waking up and just knowing i needed to play a pudge game or storm. The frontier patch was the bell heralding the end of my dota journey. I want to say thanks for everyone who worked on dota and brought it to the world.   I used to believe dota was a skillset. something I could build and use throughout my life. The energy to get better. The time invested reading patch notes and experimenting with mechanics. Learning each and every crevice of the map so i could juke or make a play wherever i was. As I get older, Dota gets faster. what used to be a real time strategy game seems to be moving more to a league of legends type of game. Having a great mind for dota has never been less valuable. As a low immortal I was around 400 wins averaging 25 mmr per win from the top end of immortal. If I could maintain a 60% winrate it would take me 2000 games to reach 15k mmr. in the time it would take to play those games the game will change drastically likely multiple times. New cracked op heroes will dominate the meta for months at a time. The game will get faster,   and my 20 years experience will become irrelevant, or worse detrimental.   Dota wasnt a game that needed *fixing*. I understand that popularity is the only metric most game designers care about now a days. But it was a deeply flawed concept that you could simply mirror league of legends design philosophy having rotations of heroes being OP instead of aiming for balance. Dota shouldnt be an APM check either. it should be strategy and execution.    If Dota was slower (Lower the amount of things you can accomplish in 60 seconds). If I didnt have to worry about the next frontier patch. If Dota was being designed for balance. If New heroes were designed as less is more. If the game design philosophy of league and fortnite had never taken root in Dota. I would still be playing. And I could recommend this game to other players.  Dota with its current team of no doubt all star industry game designers perhaps might bring Dota into a new golden age of popularity. But I will sadly not being playing. Everytime I get the itch to play dota. I remember that dota 2 really just doesnt scratch the itch anymore..","buruk"

Then comes this whole cycle of trying to download something that doesn’t actually download (unless you disable your antivirus), and after that, verifying the game files.

It completely kills my motivation to play with problems like this.

"76561199109036512","There are three major issues with this game: - Is extremely unintuitive - Relies too much on stun mechanics - Punishes newer players... hard     For some reason, the tutorial system is very unhelpful. The first 8 tutorials seem fine and dandy, but after that, every tutorial either crashes your game, is extremely difficult, or is just not functional. When you enter a game, you are given a selection of a very generous amount of heroes, each of which have 2 or 3 ability changes which serve to further change the match up to some degree, which is fine unless you have only around 30 seconds to select from them in a match. You could somewhat circumvent this by testing each hero in a single player environment, but this shows not a whole lot about your match ups against other heroes or multiple heroes or which heroes to pick to have best effect with.    When you get into a fight, you'll notice a pattern, start by killing the creeps, then charge at the enemy heroes with a three second long stun, then shred their health pool before they have a chance of doing anything about it. If you are landed in this situation, you have three options, run... and die, fight back... and die, or stun them back... and still die except you dealt some damage. This system relies too much on stuns, its even worse if your teammate happens to surround you in trees... for some reason. that also works to just kill you, and even worse, you might have lived if your teammate had helped to get the enemies off of you.    When you join a match.. everyone is relatively evenly matched, until someone gets one kill, levels up and unlocks a 3 second stun, which snowballs into the entire enemy team being twice the level of even your highest teammate, so having one teammate that's newer to the system just leads to having every enemy be twice as strong. So basically securing first blood usually means your team just... wins... for free... and there isn't much the enemy team can do about it, except keep feeding you levels.","buruk"

"76561198066400677","I would like to say that though the game is probably one of the most unique games of all time, I cannot recommend it in its current state. I think that the gameplay, phases of the game and all the heros uniqueness is what makes it one of the best games of all time.  I cant reccomend the current map state. The whole point of DOTA is to make it so that its a multiplayer online battle arena which in turn means you fight for victory via strategy, positioning and timing.   As the map has become 20% - 30% bigger, it adds more jungle camps within the game which is a bad thing. The jungle mechanic is supposed to be a downtime during the very early stages of the game and not during the mid or late game. Because you add jungle camps on the outskirts of the map, it creates where both teams just AFK farm for 30 minutes and try to scale even though if you are in an advantageous position. You cannot rally to create a smoke gank, you cannot ward because you would be alone and even if you did get a ward off, the chances you kill someone is really low because you have your team still farming the outskirts of the map.  Because of these changes, the skill level has drastically became lower for players especially their awareness of the game state. You have people barely even ganking the lanes and for people that even want to gank, you have players ignore your pings about you coming to gank and they just afk farm while you die all because of these jungle camps. It makes them less aware about the game state and just makes them go into a monochrome state where ""i am not ready to fight unless im 6 slotted"" and even then, they are sometimes useless with a 6 slot state.  Check my wraith king teammate, he had no presence whatsoever because he was always getting kited, nice item choice retard.  You have added point of interests such as the lotus area, the exp gathering area and the tormentor however they are never even contested most of the time (besides the lotus area in the early game I guess but that dies really fast). They see it as a detriment to go to that far just because they would rather go to a jungle camp and contest something that can give them even a bigger boost to fight. The tormentor has never ever been touched in japan server (and yes i know japan has all the russian rejects that dont play the game properly but that doesnt change the state it should be in) and i think that it should be changed so that it goes to where the sanctuary is.  The most fun patch was probably the updates when they had the shrines but I think with their positioning of the shrines, it made it a power spot to have turn potential. I think if you add shrines back into the game it should be next to tier two towers. This way it punishes the mid if they just use it for farm and not harassing their lane and you also enforce a retreat timing for people that have ganked but can return to the field of battle fast but not too fast to the point where it was too OP.  I think if you enjoy constant fights, you should not play this game right now. They have a lot to work on when it comes to the game especially with all of the russian reject cykas coming to japan server and ruining my game experience. Keep in mind i still get good Russian players that are constantly aggressive and I commend them, but i would say 70% are russian rejects that never played DOTA before source 2.  Drow players think they are good, anti mage players think they are good. All you did was AFK farm and you won the game. It shouldnt be this way. Fuck you drow players especially, you dont play the game properly at all you fucking retards.

"76561198867267251","The game changed so much after the  ""The New Journey"" [7.00] update. I tried to adapt but just couldn’t. One of my biggest gripes is how the developers made matches longer. Games used to last 25–40 minutes, but after this update, I was stuck in 60+ minute sessions. That’s just too much time, man.  There was also a clear shift toward forced teamplay instead of personal skill. Heroes became way tankier and harder to kill, and the introduction of new support items like aeon disk and rain drops just broke the game, in my opinion. The ban phase in ranked All Pick feels stupid, and the glyph refresh after the first set of towers falls into the same category. Dota just doesn’t feel like the old days anymore, when individual plays had a huge impact.  Moreover, the dark fantasy style got replaced by cringy emotes and cosmetics. Some Arcana items aren’t even available on the market anymore because they’re locked behind Battle Passes.  At this point, Dota 2 just isn’t the game I fell in love with. ","buruk"

"76561198136634919","Oh boy, where do I even begin? They ruined Techies. Absolutely gutted him. Once the most chaotic, creative, and downright unhinged hero in Dota 2, Techies used to be the embodiment of psychological warfare. A hero that didn’t just play the game—he reshaped it. You didn’t just lane against Techies you lived in fear of him. Every step outside your base was a gamble. Every jungle path, every rune check, every high ground push—a potential death sentence. And that was the beauty of it.    Techies wasn’t just about kills. He was about map control, area denial, vision, tempo disruption, and yes, burst damage that could delete a carry before they even realized they were in danger. He was a puzzle the enemy team had to solve every game. Do we buy detection? Do we send the support to face-check? Do we delay our push because we know there’s a minefield waiting? He forced you to think differently.    And now? Now he’s just... a stun bot with a grenade and a sad little zap. They turned a hero that used to be a walking trap card into a glorified ranged initiator. Sure, he’s more “teamfight viable” now, but at what cost? They stripped away the soul of the hero. The mad genius who could single-handedly stall a game for 20 minutes, who could turn a lost match into a win with one perfectly timed suicide and a mine stack in the trees.    People used to hate Techies, and that was the point. He was supposed to be annoying. He was supposed to be different. He was the anti-meta, the chaos factor, the wildcard. And now he’s just... another cog in the machine. Another hero with a cookie-cutter build and a predictable playstyle.    I miss the old Techies. The one who made you paranoid. The one who made you laugh maniacally when a triple kill popped up from a minefield you planted 10 minutes ago. The one who made you feel something—rage, joy, fear, awe. Now? He just makes me feel... disappointed.","buruk"

"76561198822333430","I’d like to sincerely request a review regarding my recent placement into Low Priority (LP). The incident happened during a Turbo match, which I was playing casually with my friends. Unfortunately, due to a sudden power outage caused by rain, I got disconnected and was unable to reconnect in time.  What’s particularly disheartening is receiving LP for a Turbo game—a mode that’s meant for quick, casual fun. I wasn’t trying to ruin anyone’s experience, and you can check that I was partying with friends. Getting LP for this completely takes away the fun, especially since it’s almost impossible to find LP matches, and no one wants to queue with you to clear them.  I understand if this system applies to Ranked or Competitive matches, but Turbo should be more forgiving. This experience honestly made me uninstall the game, despite the many hours I’ve spent enjoying Dota 2 over the years.  Please consider reviewing this case and the broader LP rules for Turbo matches. Casual players shouldn't be punished so severely for unintentional disconnects in non-competitive modes.","buruk"

"76561198002156890","TL:DR The actual gameplay is top-tier MOBA and valve made a solid attempt to make playing/learning the genre reasonable, but the community is rancid and multiplayer is entirely the point.  Its always odd to say you recommend the game *itself* but can't recommend playing it with other human beings, especially when the game is specifically multiplayer focused. Its very well put together: I enjoy the visuals, VA, character designs and mechanics (even if I find the shop's added complexity a little much for an already high skill ceiling game). But its a MOBA, you have to play it with others, and a good chunk of the time if you don't have a regular gaming group of friends to call upon, it is abuse and toxicity of the highest order.  It'd be one thing to spend your limited time on this earth playing a game with some of the most unpleasant people I've had the misfortune of meeting, it's entirely another to be locked in with them for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour. Its possible to be held hostage by team-mates who refuse to play communally or admit defeat when it's obvious. Its possible that your own poor play ruins the game for everyone else on your team early on, with little means to claw back the difference. It is an unforgiving game to learn and more punishment than play in all regards.  I don't know if its just part and parcel of the genre forever after now -like how if you play any given FPS multiplayer long enough you'll have a 12 year old claim copulation with your mother- but LoL and DOTA2 have killed my interest in the genre forever. If I see MOBA as a tag on a new game, I steer very clear.   If you have remarkably thick skin, an organised consistent group of friends to play with/against or just adore the genre despite its community failings, go right ahead. DOTA 2 is a good game that's terrible to play.","buruk"

I feel like the game is catering to the high end players, as that is their source of income. The communities are toxic, games you are losing get dragged out so long because the winners want to pre-long the feeling of winning, meaning 50% of games are just painful as a game could be lost, but will still drag on for another 25 minutes. Years in and no surrender mechanic to deal with this, so you get locked into suffering. Its hard to push and win with your own team because everyone else wants to drag the game out, so if you try to end the game on your own, your own team flames at you. Its just toxic. I played this game for such a long time, but I only ever play with bots with one of my friends. But the bots dont get updated at all. Modders have tried to fix the problem, but their core behaviour is so lack luster that there is only so much they can do. Make's me sad.

"76561198041364222","The fact you have to play 100h (!!!) of unranked to even be granted to access ranked is FREAKING stupid. It will result in you getting your a** clapped by some 2000+ matches nolifers. THAT will be your only experience. I've played 4 matches now and I never managed to have a good time, not even a bit. Valve somehow is the WORST at creating unranked and ranked experiences with every game they release. This game sadly is one of the cases where its even worse than I had imagined.  In CS2 you have to get level 3 or smth to play ranked. That takes smth like 2h of casual or deathmatch or whatever. Not enjoyable but not too bothersome. Now imagine the same thing but you are basically forced to play what essentially is the ranked experience, just without a rank. Versus people that have spent THOUSANDS of hours with the game already. Considering you need to gotta play 100h that is roughly 100-140 matches. How does ANYONE at Valve think that playing that amount of matches versus people that will ALWAYS wipe the floor with you is desirable.  There IS a ""beginner mode"" (which i ALWAYS dominated without any issues, and no prior MOBA experience), however that mode does NOT count towards the 100h goal even tho it essentially IS casual (just without the ""you get your a** clapped aspect, as everyone is a newb).

"76561198026489287","Mechanically, DoTA 2 is head and shoulders above any other game in the entire MOBA genre. Nothing else even comes close to the feeling of the game from a mechanics standpoint. You have more freedom and room for player skill expression than any other game in the market, more options for strange niche builds that still manage to work.  Unfortunately, it doesn't matter, because the game is crippled by its own matchmaking system. Matchmaking will attempt, very poorly, to make sure you have a roughly 50/50 win/loss rate. This means that you are effectively punished for having good matches, because they absolutely guarantee that within your next few games, you will find that Valve has gifted Steam accounts to uncontacted tribesmen from the depths of the Amazon, and they will astound you by playing videogames so poorly that it's no wonder they never advanced beyond living in huts.   On top of that, the entire normals pool can have brand new players. That causes two problems. One, new players are not matched with other new players, they're just mixed in at random, and good luck to you Johnny Newbie when you go against a six thousand hour player. Two, there is zero smurf detection, and smurfing is absolutely rampant to the point where it's likely that well over half of any ""new"" accounts are actually just some several-thousand-hour player exploiting matchmaking or farming the account up to sell it.  I wish I could recommend the game. I can't. It's a great game absolutely ruined by matchmaking and there is zero chance it ever gets fixed.","buruk"
"76561198988011766","[h1]Dota 2: A Subversive Critique of Imperialism and a Defense of Tradition[/h1] Dota 2, at first glance, appears to be just another competitive multiplayer game. But beneath its surface, it carries subtle—and sometimes overt—critiques of Western hegemony, while promoting a worldview that values tradition, faith, and non-Western perspectives. Unlike many games that uncritically glorify empire (such as Civilization or Call of Duty), Dota 2 presents a world where power is decentralized, where heroes from diverse cultures resist domination.  [h2]1. A Rejection of American Imperialism[/h2] The game’s lore features constant wars between ancient forces (the Radiant and the Dire), but unlike real-world conflicts driven by Western expansionism, these battles are cyclical, with no clear ""good vs. evil"" binary. Many heroes are former rulers or warriors who have lost their kingdoms—echoing the real-world consequences of colonialism.  Heroes like Vengeful Spirit and Terrorblade embody the consequences of betrayal and fallen empires, mirroring nations destabilized by foreign intervention.  Invoker, a supremely arrogant mage, represents the dangers of unchecked intellectual elitism—a critique of Western ""enlightened"" imperialism that imposes its will on others.  The Ancients themselves are cosmic forces locked in eternal struggle, suggesting that no empire (not even America’s) is destined to last forever.  [h2]2. A Non-Western Perspective on Power[/h2] Most mainstream games are told from a Eurocentric or American viewpoint, but Dota 2 includes heroes inspired by Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Slavic cultures:  Phantom Assassin (based on Persian lore) operates on a code of honor outside Western morality.  Ember Spirit and Storm Spirit draw from East Asian philosophies, rejecting rigid good/evil dichotomies.  Ogre Magi and Witch Doctor represent folk traditions often dismissed as ""primitive"" by colonial mindsets.  Even the game’s aesthetic—with its mix of Gothic, Islamic, and Eastern architecture—refuses to center the West as the default setting.  [h1] 3. Downsides of Dota [/h1]  The playerbase has an IQ that is just a few standard deviations short of the global average.  Final score: 1/10","buruk"

"76561198013512667","The fundamental issue with Dota 2, in a sentence, is that it is a highly advanced team game. It is one the best, actually, and for most people, that's going to cause you a lot of heartache before you can reach ""The true game"". The journey, I think, isn't worth your anger or frustration.  Allow me to be clear: I have had extensive fun playing Dota 2. A lot of fun, actually. It is one of the most competitive, interesting, and nuanced team games that you can possibly play. However, to be brief, getting to the point where you can actively have fun in that kind of competitive, nuanced, and interesting environment with strategies, theorycrafting, and novel ideas takes a lot of time and effort.  The game requires a certain buy-in for the average person to play at the sufficient levels in which mastery of the game and true team-based dynamics can come into play. For me, I have not played the game solo in years. If you have a friend group that is dedicated to it but are new, I sincerely hope they are good teachers. Most people simply are not. The average person is going to have to play hundreds of hours to catch up to those friends, many of them likely solo, because playing alongside more advanced players often ruins the matchmaking and can give you bad experiences. All of these things are steps that you have to undergo to get better at the game and eventually reach the thing you initially installed for in the first place. Along this journey, you will encounter very stupid things, you will encounter frustrations, toxicity, or other random problems which are, of course, always going to be there a little bit, but are exacerbated at the level that most new players play at.   This game is magical. Extremely fun, and extremely interesting. For the most part, though, for a solo experience or a team experience, the extreme fun has a 300 hour buy-in. There will be fun to be had at lower levels, but it will come fewer and father between, and is more than most people can tolerate. This game is free, but it will cost you your time. For most people, I cannot possibly recommend that kind of cost.","buruk"

"76561198040568419","Dota 2 used to be a pretty good game. But every update, the game gets more and more one sided, and yet the games still take just as long. It's become a massive waste of time. The matchmaking is, without a doubt, the worst I've ever seen in a game, which is impressive considering the long queue times. I just played a match that was clearly over in draft, and despite the enemy team having over 4 times our kills, their support being 7 levels higher than our team, and our team basically not playing, it still took over 35 minutes for the match to end.   That may sound like bad luck, but the truth is that's every match of Dota 2 now. Heroes are so overturned that there's no build variety. There's only 2 build types, the right way and the wrong way, so game after game you see the exact same items in the exact same order. Because of how heroes counter each other, many heroes are useless in 90+% of matchups, and require hyper specific playstyle to be useful at all. Supports (most of them) get the short end of the stick. I don't know why they hate CM so much, but she gets nerfed every patch despite hardly anyone playing her. Already OP heroes will get buffs for seemingly no reason, and this just results in the same group of 20 heroes being constantly played in matches that are clearly over at the hero selection screen.  Dota's best days are long, long behind, and it's not worth picking up for anyone.","buruk"

"76561198132037083","Dota 2: The Toxic Ex You Can’t Quit  Dota 2, the MOBA that’s less a game and more an abusive relationship you keep crawling back to, hoping it’ll change. Spoiler: it won’t. This free-to-play nightmare has been hooking players since 2013 like a bad habit you swear you’ll kick tomorrow. It’s the kind of game that promises you glory, teamwork, and epic moments, but delivers soul-crushing losses, teammates who think “ward” is a four-letter curse, and a creeping suspicion that you’re the problem.  Playing Dota is like dating someone who’s hot but unhinged. The highs are intoxicating—nailing a five-man Black Hole as Enigma, stealing an Aegis, a clutch arrow\hook that hits, or watching your carry finally figure out how to right-click after 40 minutes. But the lows? Oh, they’re a dumpster fire. You’re stuck in a 50-minute slogfest, your midlaner’s 0-12, and the enemy Phantom Assassin is so fed she’s basically a war crime. You tell yourself “just one more game,” but three hours later, you’re screaming into the void and googling “how to uninstall my entire personality.”  The community doesn’t help. It’s a mix of brilliant tacticians and people who’d fail a CAPTCHA test. You’ll meet a player who types out all your abilities like it’s Morse code, after they pulled a Rambo on the other side of the map, a support who steals your farm “for the team,” and a carry who thinks boots are optional. It’s a relationship that can’t end on good terms—either you win and smugly pretend you’re the next TI champ, or you lose and blame everyone else while secretly hating yourself. There’s no clean breakup here it’s all slammed doors and burned bridges.  When you finally leave Dota—and you will, trust me—don’t look back. Delete it, block its number, and remember why you walked away: the sleepless nights, the shattered keyboards, the friends you lost because “one more game” turned into a hostage situation. Sure, the memories of that one perfect rampage might whisper sweet nothings, but don’t fall for it. Dota 2 doesn’t love you—it just knows how to keep you trapped. Stay gone, and maybe you’ll find peace in something less masochistic, like Candy Crush or taxes.  Rating: 8/10 if you hate yourself, 2/10 if you value your sanity.  Play at your own risk.","buruk"
"76561198068855435","The matchmaking system is very stupid.. I know the game had to deal with smurfs but beware if you're a normal player and you won ""too many"" consecutive matches, the matchmaking system will give you a LOT more unfair and one-sided matches. The system is taking note of your performance in your previous matches and if it's too good, you get teamed up with low performing players where it's impossible to win probably for the next 30 matches. Smurfs are only a minority (very likely less than 1% of population) of the community but this matchmaking system affects the whole population of players.  The entire system of this so-called ""balanced"" matchmaking is doing more harm than the smurfs themselves. My goodness,  back in the day, how often do you encounter smurfs in every 100 matches? This system they have put in place is just stupid.

"76561198037477499","The game is so awful. It just crashed 2 games in a row causing me to get into low priority mode which takes 10 minutes at least to find a match, and if you're lucky you'll get the even 50% win/loss rate which means 8 1-hour games plus 80 minutes to queue. So due to the game crashing, a player needs to put in 10 hours of unwanted gameplay before they can access the game they've sunk loads of money into. I'm not sure that makes sense for a game that is meant to be fun. UPDATE: took me 56 hours to get out of the game mode, just asked a teamate to use the vision in the jungle I bought him, he reported me and now I'm banned from using chat wheels which I get from paying a subscription fee for dota plus...

"76561197996986133","A long time ago, I used to play Dota 2. Today I'll write a review to celebrate leaving it for good.  I will start with a positive outlook: If you already like MOBAs at a fundamental level or enjoy competitive gaming in general, then you might enjoy Dota 2. I think it still has few restrictions to hero selection, a large hero pool with some unique playstyles, no pay-to-win schemes and an active playerbase. However, I would not recommend this game even if the above resonates with you.   Short review: while everyone has their own gaming preferences, it's more than worth exploring beyond just MOBAs. There are plenty of genres out there that can offer a far more fun experience.  Long review: Despite its initial appeal due to its blend of strategy, skill and teamwork, Dota 2 (and the MOBA genre) fell victim to several factors contributing to its current stature within the gaming comunity: - The competitive nature of these multiplayer games often breeds an environment ripe for animosity and vitriol, making it hard to enjoy them. One cannot ignore the pervasive issue of negative attitudes among players. - Tons of heroes, but balance problems. Updates are all over the place, so you can't count on your favorites no matter how skilled you are. - The game focuses way too much on eSports, leaving average players in the dust. It feels more about competitive stats than having fun. - Sure, there are updates, but they never really fix the bigger issues and don't innovate much. MOBA is a pretty rigid genre. - Finally, you can spend hours playing without feeling like you've accomplished anything. The progression feels empty, it's easy to get disillusioned. The sense of achievement becomes increasingly elusive, especially amidst a sea of repetitive setbacks/challenges.  Overall, Dota 2 (and MOBAs as a whole) stands out less as a testament to what online gaming can achieve and more as a reminder of its potential pitfalls: venomous players, balance issues, and ultimately, diminished return on investment from time spent engaging with such games. There are so many games out there that deserve your time more than any MOBA ever will.","buruk"

This is just the tip of the iceberg, do yourself a favour and turn around. If you do decide to stay, by no means give them your money. The Dota+ subscription which is supposed to help pair you with other players at your level does not actually work. The coaches that are supposed to help you in game are rarely available.

As with all games of this style the community can be both the best and worst part of this game, but if you're trying to learn the game in matches with strangers be prepared to be yelled at to play bot games to get better, then completely crush the bots on the highest difficulty because they're incompetent compared to the players at even the lowest rank. The only people who are likely to enjoy this game are people who have either played thousands of hours of MOBAs already, or people who's goal isn't actually to play the game but instead want to trash talk in chat. This game has a huge problem with not only bots but also smurfs, and each match is almost guaranteed to be completely one sided, whether it's for or against you, except for at the highest levels of play. If you love MOBAs and don't care how many slurs they call you in chat, then this game may be the best you've ever played, but for the average player I could never recommend it.
