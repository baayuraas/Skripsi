"76561198058437603","If you've ever wanted to age 40 years in a weekend, cry in three different emotional languages, and question your life choices every 15 minutes, congratulations — Dota 2 is your soulmate and your captor.    The game is ""free to play,"" which is ironic, because you pay with your soul. The tutorial tells you it's a strategy game, but what it fails to mention is that your biggest opponent is your own teammates. Playing Dota is like being in a hostage situation where you're also one of the kidnappers.    The matchmaking system is powered by an advanced AI that matches you with people who have either just installed the game, or just escaped a mental institution. Sometimes both. Balance? Oh, you mean the illusion of hope?    You'll find yourself saying things like:    “Why is Techies in my game again?”    “Why is the support farming mid?”    “Why am I still playing this?”    Each match starts with optimism and ends with depression, kind of like birthdays after you turn 30.    Let’s talk about toxicity. Dota 2 doesn’t have toxic players. No, that would be too simple. It has biohazard waste in voice chat. The kind of people who will ping your death three times, call you slurs in three languages, then proceed to die alone in the forest for 40 minutes.    The worst part? You’ll love it. Because winning in Dota 2 is like finding meaning in your life — rare, euphoric, and followed by a crushing loss that resets you back to reality.    In summary:  Dota 2 is the best worst thing to ever happen to me. It’s like Stockholm Syndrome with patch notes. 10/10 would uninstall and reinstall again out of pure spite.","baik"

"76561199528783285","Отличная игра в которой тебе всё расскажут и даже не только про игру! Ты узнаешь о необычных работах своих родственников, о том насколько много людей любит и обожает твою маму. Также один из плюсов это большой выбор героев с не сложным управлением. Например Invoker очень легкий персонаж с кучей урона подходящий для поднятия рейтинга. Комьюнити очень хорошее, иногда встречаются игроки которые настолько хорошо играют, что ломают все свои вещи и собирают новые так как хотят дать фору врагам. Также разработчики очень усердно работают над обновлениями которые выходят раз в полгода и выпускаются для того чтобы онлайн повысился с 10 человек до 11 ( при этом в игру зашел сам разработчик). Ну в целом плюсы перечислять можно долго, а вот насчет минусов, их нет. Спасибо за внимание, надеюсь этот отзыв поможет читающим!","baik"
"76561198106503136","I only played this because League of Legends put me in timeout for telling a 13-year-old jungler to uninstall their soul.    Let me set the scene: it was a dark, shameful day. Riot Games had finally pulled the plug on my main account after a small misunderstanding involving ten ping spams, three racial slurs (none mine!), and one elo-defining loss. So what did I do? Reflect? Seek therapy? Touch grass?    No. I rebounded hard—straight into the open, masochistic arms of Dota 2.    And let me tell you: it was like crawling out of a frat house fight pit and stumbling into a sadistic chess tournament being played by Russian AIs with gambling addictions. This isn’t a game. It’s a graduate-level course in suffering, delivered exclusively through slurs, spreadsheets, and a mini-map that actively gaslights you.    You think League is toxic? Dota 2 players don’t flame you—they curse your bloodline. A Peruvian witch doctor once told me to feed my courier to Roshan and then die in real life. I didn’t even know what a courier was yet. Beautiful.    The learning curve? Imagine climbing Mount Everest, but it's vertical, on fire, and halfway up someone throws a techies minefield at your crotch. Every character has 42 active abilities, a secret satanic pact, and a passive-aggressive Reddit community explaining why you're doing it all wrong. There’s no “meta”—there’s only pain, and ten dudes yelling in five languages about “item timings” while your tower disintegrates like your self-esteem.    But oh, the complexity. The strategy. The high you get from landing a five-man black hole or denying a creep like a smug little Victorian landlord. I once got a triple kill with a flaming horseman while being coached mid-game by a Russian with a drinking problem and a heart of gold. It was the most bonding I’ve experienced since my parents’ divorce.    And the graphics? It looks like a Warhammer figurine collection got possessed by Satan and reanimated using Valve’s leftover Half-Life particles. Every match feels like a beautiful fever dream inside a burning cathedral.    Final Thoughts:  Dota 2 is the game you play when you’ve hit rock bottom in League and decided to dig deeper. It doesn’t hold your hand. It rips your hand off, feeds it to a jungle creep, and then blames you for feeding. It’s brutal, exhilarating, and almost certainly responsible for 12% of global blood pressure medication sales.    I came here because I was banned.  I stayed because the voices in my head said ""GLHF.""    10/10. Would flame myself again.","baik"
"76561198080449788","Dota 2 is like a toxic relationship—you hate it, you love it, you can’t quit it. One minute you’re outplaying opponents like a grandmaster, the next you’re getting flamed by a 12-year-old playing Techies. The learning curve? More like a learning cliff. But once you get hooked, there’s no escape.  The gameplay is deep, the heroes are diverse, and every match feels like a new disaster (or masterpiece). Just remember: if you win, it’s all skill. If you lose? Obviously, your team’s fault.  10/10 – Would feed mid again.","baik"
"76561198363396230","Man, DOTA will always be a good game. The best MOBA for me. Never been bored playing it and always makes me comeback for more. The player based are somewhat toxic but in a competitive way, it only depends on how you view and take it. The time, attention, money and friendship that I manage to make and spend in this game will always be worth it. After playing this game for many years I have decided to quit, hence the review. I am quitting due to medical reasons and I am already too old for game. It's just pure nostalgia that fuels me to continue but it is time to hang up. Enjoy the game, always have a positive mental attitude towards the game and thank you DOTA for all the memories. GGWP!","baik"
"76561198075454868","Dota 2, not a bad thing I can say about the game itself. I have spent thousands of hours, played approximately 7000 games, grinded to Immortal (highest possible medal) in ranked and finally got there after 10 years of playing but it has been a rollercoaster. The game itself is well optimised, no 2 games are exactly the same, it's a fantastic game to play with friends if you can fill a party and you can be as creative as you like with how you play a lot of heroes that the game has to offer.  I feel like if you are reading this, you have probably seen so many reviews telling you not to play because of the community, and that can't be ignored. I totally agree with the other reviews saying how bad the player base is. Ultimately, although a competitive game is usually a lot more fun when you are winning, you can't play a game that you are only going to have fun when you are winning otherwise if you end up playing the game for 10000 hours like me, you will only enjoy 5000 hours of gameplay with a 50% winrate. If you are eager to play this game, the most overpowered ability everyone can use in game is the mute button, pre-mute the entire lobby upon loading in. If your team start losing, 9/10 either you will be flamed (even if you are playing well) or the whole team cohesion breaks down.   If the reason you want to play this game is to enjoy the teamplay and social aspect of playing a 5 vs 5 competitive game, I suggest you play something else. If you want to challenge yourself as a solo player, focus on your game entirely and develop your skill... then this game is extremely rewarding as you get better. I love this game and always will, but I am in love with the game itself and certainly not the people who play it. These people have nothing else going on in their lives and are essentially gambling with their serotonin, if they winning they are happy and if they losing they are children.  To put it into perspective, I come home from a long day of work and maybe play 1 or 2 games, I play something fun and creative, like a hero that is usually an offlane hero as a carry, if we win I'm a legend, if we lose people start crying and start pointing the finger. I have fun regardless because of the mute button, but if you don't have thick skin, this game will negatively affect your happiness.  Good luck and have fun, praying that the community treats you well (although I doubt it).","baik"

"76561198051539046","I've been playing Dota since its early days as a custom map in Warcraft III long before Dota 2 became the global phenomenon it is today. For me, this isn't just a game it's a huge part of my childhood and personal growth.  From Dota 1 to Dota 2, I've witnessed how the game evolved so called new mechanics, updated heroes, refined graphics, and better matchmaking systems. While some changes felt overwhelming at first, I’ve come to appreciate that evolution is part of what makes Dota such a masterpiece. It constantly challenges you to adapt, learn, and grow.  But Dota is more than just a game of mechanics and skill. It’s taught me so much about critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and even how to manage my emotions during high-pressure, often chaotic moments. Every match is unpredictable and that’s what makes it endlessly rewarding.  My Advice: Don’t play this game if you have low patience, poor communication, or if you prefer solo gameplay.  Dota is not for trolls or for those who take team coordination lightly.  If you're ready to be humbled, challenged, and (eventually) sharpened—welcome aboard.  This game holds many cherished memories, including countless moments with online friends I've made along the way. Some of them are no longer with us, and I want to say: RIP to my fallen teammates—you’ll always be part of my journey.  Cheers to Dota—for being more than just a game. It’s a lifelong lesson in resilience, strategy, and camaraderie. GGWP. GGEZ ","baik"

"76561198307637623","With over 3,800 hours poured into Dota 2, I can confidently say this game is more than just a pastime, it's a way of life. Every match is a new challenge, where strategy, teamwork, and skill are constantly put to the test. No two games are ever the same, and that’s what makes it so addicting. The depth of mechanics, hero variety, and the ever-evolving meta keep things fresh even after thousands of hours.  The feeling of executing the perfect team fight, landing that game-changing Black Hole, or carrying your team to victory after a grueling 60-minute battle is unmatched. But on the flip side, the game will test your patience like nothing else. The highs are incredible, but the lows can be brutal. It's a game that rewards dedication and punishes mistakes, making every win feel truly earned.  The community can be intense, and the learning curve is steep, but once you get past the initial struggle, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Whether you're playing casually or grinding ranked, every match teaches you something new. Even after thousands of hours, I still find myself improving and discovering new ways to outplay opponents.  Dota 2 is not just a game, it's a never-ending battle of wits and reflexes that keeps you coming back for more. If you’re willing to invest the time and effort, it’s one of the most satisfying and competitive experiences out there.","baik"

"76561198235835584","[h1] Dota 2: The Pinnacle of Competitive MOBA Gaming [/h1]  [h1] Overview [/h1] Dota 2, developed by Valve, is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game and a sequel to the iconic Defense of the Ancients mod for Warcraft III. It stands as one of the most challenging and rewarding competitive games, combining strategic depth, intense gameplay, and an active esports scene.  [h1] Story and Atmosphere [/h1] While Dota 2 primarily focuses on gameplay, its lore adds depth to the universe. Each hero has a unique backstory, and interactions hint at a larger narrative involving ancient forces, rivalries, and alliances. However, the story remains in the background, accessible mainly to those who seek it. The game’s visuals and sound design complement its epic tone, creating a grand battlefield atmosphere.  [h1] Gameplay[/h1] Dota 2 pits two teams of five against each other, with the objective of destroying the enemy’s Ancient. Players select from a vast roster of over 120 heroes, each with unique abilities and roles. Success relies on teamwork, strategy, and individual skill. The game features deep mechanics, including item builds, map control, and timing, making each match unique and dynamic.  [h1] Pros [/h1] [list]     [*]Strategic Depth: Endless strategies and hero combinations keep the game fresh.     [*]Vast Hero Roster: Over 120 heroes cater to various playstyles.     [*]MEsports Scene: One of the most prominent esports games, with massive tournaments like The International.     [*]Free-to-Play Model: All heroes are unlocked from the start, ensuring fairness. [/list]  [h1] Cons [/h1] [list]     [*]Steep Learning Curve: New players may struggle with the complex mechanics and toxic community.     [*]Time Investment: Matches can last 30-60 minutes, requiring significant commitment.     [*]High Skill Ceiling: While rewarding, mastering the game can be overwhelming for casual players. [/list]  [h1] Final [/h1] Dota 2 is a masterpiece for competitive gaming enthusiasts, offering unparalleled depth and a thriving community. However, its complexity and demanding nature may deter casual gamers.  [h1] Score: 90/100 [/h1]","baik"
"76561199097802766","I use to be a League of Legends player.  My friend for years kept harassing me to play Dota 2. He was insistent that Dota was the greatest MOBA to exist, the original but far better game. Immature and young i retorted his statement for years, blind with stupidity.  Then in 2022 i grew up, moved out, lived on my own, i finally said okay ill give Dota a chance, and immediately fell in love with the game. The Complexity and vast array of strategical possibilities were unparalleled, after playing Dota, LOL seemed like a oversimplified kids game for degenerate adults. In 1 year of playing the game i climbed through the ranks to ancient 5. I treasure the amount of exhilarating and unforgettable experiences I've had playing this game. Unfortunately life catches up to you and my time on this great game has come to a near halt.

It is for those who crave to feel, to bleed, to struggle, to conquer.  For those who want to clash with others, raw and unfiltered, no masks, no censorship.    Dota 2 is not just a game.

"76561198242530534","(Played from 2015–2020)  Dota 2 is an amazing game, no doubt about it. The complexity, variety, and depth make it a masterpiece in its genre. No two matches are ever the same, which keeps things fresh and exciting every time you play. It’s especially fun with friends, where teamwork and coordination can lead to some of the most satisfying victories you’ll ever experience in gaming.  But beware—this game is highly addictive. Once you're in, it’s hard to let go. The thrill of improving, the rush of a good play, and the challenge of outsmarting your opponents create a loop that’s incredibly difficult to break. For me, Dota 2 became more than a game—it was a daily ritual for five years.  However, it’s not all perfect. Playing with strangers can sometimes ruin the experience, especially when someone decides to throw the game or has a bad attitude. And the addictive nature of Dota 2 can make it all-consuming if you’re not careful.  That said, I somehow managed to quit in 2020. Breaking free wasn’t easy, but I’m glad I did. Still, I’ll always respect what this game offers—its unmatched strategy, intense gameplay, and unforgettable moments.

The buyback mechanic, being able to teleport anywhere, and the crazy amount of item combinations really make the game deep. I still struggle with learning all the items, but that’s part of what keeps it fun you can play the same hero in so many different ways. What I personally love the most is the courier.

The ones where it is back and forth and neither side knows who is going to win until the ancient falls. The ones where you think you're about to lose, and somehow you and your team are able to win a good team fight and dive right down the middle and destroy their ancient while none of them have buybacks.

I'd highly recommend playing turbo and ability draft to new players as well as normal pubs if you want to learn the game while having fun.

"76561198431602813","I started playing a week ago, and it's been a lot of fun so far. A bit of a learning curve is required, but that's fun since there are so many heroes to learn until you find a few that you can bounce to.     I recommend trying a few bot matches to get the hang of things with heroes and play styles before jumping into online, at least that's what I did and now I feel more confident playing against others.    Overall, I would recommend Dota 2. It's fun and easy to get into, and enjoyable if you got 30-40 minutes to burn.","baik"
"76561199272677140","Dota 2 is one of the most complex, punishing, and addictive games you’ll ever play. The learning curve isn’t just steep—it’s a cliff. New players will get crushed repeatedly, often with little explanation. The community can be toxic, especially to beginners, and mistakes (even small ones) are rarely forgiven.  Matches are long, intense, and mentally draining. You'll spend hundreds of hours just to feel ""okay"" at the game. And once you're hooked, it becomes a cycle of frustration, salt, and the occasional glorious win that keeps you coming back.  It’s not for the faint of heart—but if you’re a glutton for punishment and love a challenge, Dota 2 will consume your soul in the best (and worst) way possible.","baik"

"76561198148444934","Dota 2 used to be one of my go-to games for its strategic depth, team coordination, and the excitement of high-stakes matches. However, over the past few years, I've noticed that the game has taken a turn for the worse due to recent updates. The constant changes to heroes, items, and game mechanics have made the game feel less balanced and more frustrating. It seems like every patch introduces new overpowered heroes or items, which disrupts the meta and makes the game less enjoyable for those who don't have the time to constantly adapt. Moreover, the introduction of new mechanics has made the game overly complicated and less accessible to both new and returning players. The focus on monetization, such as battle passes and cosmetic items, feels like it has taken priority over improving the core gameplay experience. While the game still has its merits and remains good in many aspects, these changes have made it less fun and more of a chore for me. Consequently, I no longer play Dota 2 as much as I used to. I hope Valve can find a balance between innovation and maintaining the aspects of the game that made it great in the first place.","baik"

But for all its chaos, stress, and heartbreak, I keep coming back. And I know I’m not alone. Every match is a high-stakes battle of wits, skill, and decision-making. One minute you’re coordinating the perfect teamfight, the next you’re questioning your life choices after a disastrous throw. It’s brutal, it’s punishing, and somehow, it’s still incredibly rewarding. There’s something addictive about the depth of this game — the endless strategies, the hero pool, the meta shifts, the synergy between teammates (or lack thereof). Even when I rage-quit, I find myself queuing up again, chasing that one perfect game. Dota 2 isn’t for everyone. It can be toxic, frustrating, and deeply unforgiving.

Dota 2 teaches you about resilience, about the highs and lows of victory and defeat, and how every mistake is a lesson. There’s something about that rush of a well-executed strategy, the thrill of pushing forward to take that final tower, that makes Dota 2 more than just a game—it’s an emotional experience that stays with you long after the match is over.","baik"

This game is a flawless beast of strategy and madness, with maps that pop and heroes that feel like they leapt out of a blockbuster. I made friends so awesome we’re still memeing in group chats, and yeah, I racked up some iconic enemies too (lol, sorry to that guy I fed in mid!). 😎 It defined my youth with screams and giggles, even if I was more minion than master. If you love MOBAs and aren’t a total flop like me, dive into this gem! 🗡️   Pros:  Perfect game with strategy that’s pure genius (or not).  Matches with my cousin that were chaotic bliss.  Epic friendships and hilarious rivalries (haha).  Stunning visuals and heroes that steal the show.   Cons:  Learning curve steeper than a rocket launch.  Community can get a bit spicy sometimes.","baik"
"76561198083553340","Introduction Dota 2 is an iconic multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve Corporation. Released in 2013, the game is the successor to the Warcraft III: Defense of the Ancients (DotA) modification and has since grown into one of the main esports titans. Its complex gameplay, endless strategic depth, and active community make it a unique phenomenon in the gaming industry.  Gameplay: Skill vs. Tactics Dota 2 is based on battles between two teams of five players, the goal of which is to destroy the enemy ""fortress"" (Ancient), while protecting their own. Each player controls a unique hero with a set of abilities that develop during the match. Here, not only reaction and mechanical skill are important, but also team coordination, choice of tactics, and map control.  - Heroes and roles: More than 120 heroes with different roles (tanks, support, carry, mages) allow you to endlessly experiment with combinations. - Items and Progression: Gold and XP earned in combat unlock powerful items and upgrades, adding layers of strategy.  - Match Dynamics: Games last between 20 and 60 minutes, with the outcome often decided in decisive team skirmishes.  Graphics and Sound: Functionality and Atmosphere Dota 2 doesn’t strive for photorealism, but its vibrant art style and detailed maps have stood the test of time. Regular visual updates and ability effects are pleasing to the eye. The sound design perfectly complements the gameplay: unique hero lines, ability cues, and epic music at critical moments enhance immersion.  Features and Community - Free-to-Play: All in-game benefits are available without paying. Purchases only concern cosmetics (skins, animations), which maintains balance. - Esports: The International tournament attracts millions of viewers every year, and prize pools reach tens of millions of dollars. - Tutorials and Community: The game offers tutorials and modes for beginners, but the steep learning curve means there is a high barrier to entry. The community is active, but sometimes toxic, which is something to consider.  Pros: + Incredible strategic depth and replayability. + Regular updates and support from Valve. + Vibrant esports scene and spectacular tournaments. + Fair monetization without pay-to-win.  Cons: - Complexity for beginners: requires time to master the mechanics and meta. - Potentially toxic players in public matches. - Match lengths can be tiring.  Conclusion Dota 2 is a game for those willing to dedicate time to learning its mechanics and nuances. It rewards skill, teamwork, and strategic thinking, while remaining one of the most complex and intense MOBAs on the market. If you're looking for a challenge, want to dive into the eSports culture, or just enjoy fast-paced tactical battles, Dota 2 is worth a try. However, those who prefer casual gameplay or are afraid of high difficulty may want to consider other titles in the genre.","baik"
"76561197967288976","If you’ve ever thought, “I’d like to systematically erode my will to live while being yelled at in Russian,” Dota 2 is the game for you. With over 7000 hours invested — or, more accurately, irretrievably discarded — I can confidently say that Dota 2 doesn’t just suck your soul. It files a change-of-ownership form with the devil, adds your essence to a punch card, and hands you a battle pass as consolation.    The thrill of logging in has long since devolved into a Pavlovian dread-response. Each match is less a game and more a hostage negotiation where your captors are twelve-year-olds with no filter, teammates who pick Techies unironically, and a matchmaking system that could be replaced by a blindfolded chimp throwing darts at a dartboard labeled “MMR.”    The community, if we can even call it that, is a vibrant mosaic of dysfunction. A glorious melting pot of racism, slurs, death threats, and unsolicited life advice from people who unironically use anime profile pictures and think “support diff” is a valid argument.    Friendships? Gone. Relationships? Dismantled. Playing Dota 2 with someone you love is like renovating a house with them: one of you will end up in therapy, and the other will just leave. If you want to test the strength of any bond, forget trust falls. Queue up for ranked.    And yet, despite everything — the emotional scarring, the social carnage, the existential despair — the game calls you back. Not with excitement, but with grim obligation. Like paying taxes. Or visiting a relative in the hospital who doesn’t remember your name but still manages to call you a disappointment.    Dota 2 is not a game. It’s a lifestyle choice. A bad one. Like ketamine at a children’s party.    Play it if you must. But know this: Dota 2 doesn't just ruin your day. It ruins your decade.","baik"

When it comes to diversity of heroes, abilities, and powerful items, Dota boasts an endless array—no two games are the same. Any hero can fill multiple roles, and there's an abundance of items to help meet the needs of each game.

There are so many heroes that sometimes I feel like I’m one of them – usually the one who dies first.

Developed by Valve, it has become a true classic of competitive gaming, with a global community and a professional scene that has shaped modern esports.    At its core, Dota 2 is a 5v5 strategy game where players choose from a vast roster of unique heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles. The goal is simple in theory but incredibly complex in practice: destroy the enemy’s Ancient before they destroy yours. What makes the game so compelling is the depth of its mechanics—every match feels different because of the countless possible hero combinations, item builds, and team strategies.    The game’s steep learning curve is both its biggest challenge and its greatest strength. New players may find themselves overwhelmed by the complexity, but those who invest time are rewarded with unmatched depth and satisfaction. No two games are ever alike, and small decisions often determine victory or defeat.    Visually, Dota 2 is polished and constantly updated, with new cosmetics, seasonal events, and balance patches keeping the experience fresh. The competitive scene, highlighted by The International—the game’s premier tournament with record-breaking prize pools—remains a spectacle that attracts millions of viewers worldwide.    Dota 2 is not for everyone. It requires patience, teamwork, and resilience. But for those willing to embrace its difficulty, it offers one of the richest and most rewarding multiplayer experiences in gaming.","baik"

The game also teaches patience, decision-making, and coordination with teammates, making victories feel truly rewarding.

"76561198267934355","I would like to believe that this game had good intentions, never sought to intentionally harm anyone, and truly wanted to use its hour experience to create awareness towards child sexual crimes. I also believe that it can, at times, effectively disgust you, and fool you into thinking there is more to the game than its gross premise.    my d0Ooota 22  is an experience unlike any other, and it should be ashamed for it. Nobody, and certainly victims, need to be ""aware"" of the existence of child sexual assault in the manner it presents itself. Not only is it incredibly blunt in the laziest way possible, but the game immediately plays its biggest hand in the first 5 minutes when the player character, (a little girl who can be estimated to be as young as 11 years old and completely uneducated to the point her mental age seems far younger) expresses her distaste towards pills she's required to take every night because they make her tired. Immediately my eyes deceive throws all subtlety out the window, and just becomes a harrowing slog through the daily imprisonment of this poor child, and there's nothing the player can do but sit there and be complicit in the crime for another 30 minutes. And your reward for trusting the game to tell an interesting story, and going down the bad ending is a revolting line that reveals the unaware forced pregnancy of the child protagonist, only then to be given a credits scroll that attempts to empower victims, remind them they aren't alone in their experiences, and that they can always find strength in the struggle. What a gross, deaf thing to say after putting, who they would assume are victims, through this waste of time and art.    Shame on you, nouhidev, shame on you for engaging in a subject you do not understand, and taking a moral high ground on. Shame on you for wasting an hour of my life with a message that means nothing. Many people believe your game is based on the Josef Fritzl case which follows a similar story, and I am sad that anyone could believe you would be honoring the victims of Fritzl through this game. You are a depraved, blind human being who thought a post on r/TwoSentenceHorror about a falsely imprisoned child required your expert touch-ups of child molestation and drugging.    Shame on you, never make another game.    Helpful?  Yes  I have to agree that the little message in the credits is just a lame attempt at being empathetic. As someone who survived SA, yeah, cool, heard it multiple times, kind of tired of it. Kind of tired of being told I may be too sensitive to deal with fiction that deals with it too.    My issue isn't that it's ""triggering"" - it may be trying to shine a light on something that happens in reality, but it is still just fiction, and I can separate fiction from reality. My issue is that it's just kind of boring and reeks of pandering. The wait times for certain triggers are a bit too long and the keys feel ""sticky"", as if e and enter to confirm some things just don't work some times. I do appreciate there aren't any ""jump scares"" (there's a slight startle in one of the dream sequences but it's not associated with scary flashing lights, a ""scary"" face too close to the screen all of a sudden, or a truly deafening sting of any sort).    To the reviewer who says this can't help people who have gone through it, please grow up and don't police what helps people cope.

The atmosphere, the graphics, the dialogue, literally everything is so eerie, the dreams are genuinely creepy. I've played a bunch of horror games and not a lot really scared me but this is different, I don't' if i can say I was scared, just sickened. I've only unlocked one ending, the bad ending and I'm not sure if I'm gonna try to get the second one. When I first opened the game I immediately recognized what this was based off of, which makes it so much worse. The only positive thing i can say is that it was very immersive, but I wouldn't recommend it.  A twisted, dark, and engaging narrative that gradually unravels itself over the course of the experience.  Includes sensitive and distressing subject matter, including highly triggering elements such as suggested sexual abuse. It may be deeply unsettling to some players. Individuals who find disturbing content distressing or have experienced trauma related to these triggers are advised to refrain from playing.I have to agree that the little message in the credits is just a lame attempt at being empathetic. As someone who survived SA, yeah, cool, heard it multiple times, kind of tired of it. Kind of tired of being told I may be too sensitive to deal with fiction that deals with it too.    My issue isn't that it's ""triggering"" - it may be trying to shine a light on something that happens in reality, but it is still just fiction, and I can separate fiction from reality. My issue is that it's just kind of boring and reeks of pandering. The wait times for certain triggers are a bit too long and the keys feel ""sticky"", as if e and enter to confirm some things just don't work some times. I do appreciate there aren't any ""jump scares"" (there's a slight startle in one of the dream sequences but it's not associated with scary flashing lights, a ""scary"" face too close to the screen all of a sudden, or a truly deafening sting of any sort).  a short and effective game but the creator is a pedo Separate the Art, from the Artist. scary but got used. last part with the 4 kids was kinda cutegood experience :0 BUT VERY SAD!!!!  acc rlly sad horror type game but extremely good  it made me cry at the end, when you put yourself in the perspective of an innocent child and many others, i loved it  It's a great short horror game, but the story is heartbreaking.  To the reviewer who says this can't help people who have gone through it, please grow up and don't police what helps people cope. Dark fiction is actually a certified therapy for overcom","baik"

"76561197967501792","I'm hitting 'Yes', but with a huge warning.    The Good:  The game itself is a masterpiece. The strategy is complex, the heroes are cool, and winning a tough game is one of the best feelings in gaming.    The Bad:  You will run into a TON of smurfs. Seriously. High-skilled players on new accounts who just ruin the match for everyone else. It feels completely unfair and honestly makes you want to uninstall sometimes.    So, if you can stomach the bad part (or play with friends), go for it. If not, maybe wait until Valve actually fixes this problem.","baik"

Sometimes, you'll play awful, and the entire game will be your fault, but sometimes...just sometimes, You make the play.   And that's what makes Dota a great game, to me at least.   I enjoy it becaues when I play, I block all other distractions out, if I do, I play well. But when I need a break, I take them.   Over all, I'm around 7,500 hours in, which is astonishing to anyone outside of steam. And they think i'm the best of all time.   But i'm still just an average player.

"76561198869796797","  This game is filled with both admirable and unpleasant moments. One of the most disheartening issues that frequently occurs in many matches is encountering boosters—skilled and intelligent yet dishonorable players who, for a minimal fee, compromise the integrity of the game and make matches unfair. It is evident that Valve, as the developer, benefits from this undesirable situation otherwise, improving it for the sake of fair play and the players’ experience would not be a difficult task.","baik"

However, learning the game by studying it is cool, but you will probably be under pressure from your own team. This game is like chess, it's even better. You have to think more, you have to take every moments. Get to know the characters, and there are a lot of them, more than 120 if I'm not mistaken.

"76561199212794929","Dota 2 is the granddaddy of making you question every life choice, but in the best way possible. It’s not just a MOBA it’s Valve’s never-ending science experiment where five strangers try to cooperate (and usually flame each other) for an hour, all because someone picked Techies.  At first glance, you’re like, “Okay, just smash their Ancient, got it.” But then you realize there’s a billion tiny things to juggle: weird hero powers, bonkers item builds, and a meta that changes faster than Twitter drama. Over 120 heroes, by the way, so good luck learning them all. Every match is like opening a new puzzle box, except sometimes it explodes in your face.  The gameplay? Absolute chaos, but with a rhythm. You’re farming, you’re warding, you’re yelling at your carry for stealing your last hit. One second you’re a farming bot, next you’re in a teamfight where one missed spell means instant regret. Sometimes you pull off a sick play and feel like a genius other times you misclick and want to uninstall. That’s Dota, baby.  And don’t get me started on the learning curve, it’s more like falling off a cliff. You’ll lose. A lot. Even the pros keep getting blindsided by new patches. Valve loves to shake things up: new items, hero reworks, weird balance changes. Blink and you’re outdated.  But when you finally get it, like really nail a combo or outsmart the enemy? That rush is unreal. Every game tells a different story personalities flare, egos clash, someone always blames the support. It’s beautiful chaos.  Visually, Dota 2’s got style. Clean graphics, flashy spells, and you can actually tell what’s happening (most of the time). The sound design? Legendary. That announcer pack calling your rampage, pure dopamine.  Let’s talk esports for a sec. The International isn’t just another tourney, it’s basically the Super Bowl of nerds, raining ridiculous amounts of cash and hype. The Dota community is wild, sometimes toxic, but always passionate. They’ll argue about the meta for days, but that’s half the fun.  At the end of the day, Dota 2 isn’t for quitters. It wants your brain, your reflexes, your soul. But if you’re up for the challenge, there’s nothing quite like it. It’s the ultimate game of wits, teamwork, and occasionally, pure chaos. Welcome to the madness.","baik"

"76561198865895697","The Game is simple and yet it require you to at least have 100 hrs to understand the basics of the game. The wide range of heroes and items makes this game a little complicated for the new comers which is fine if you are ready to invest your time in it at least 100 hrs for basics and 500 hrs to understand heroes and their abilities, items.  The game have 5 positions and 3 lanes on each side with each position having their part to play in the game. Its a proper team game you cannot side on your teammate's shoulder for a free ride. As far as i understand the game the key 5 positions are 1st the carry as the name describe you gotta do it if your are pos 1. 2nd The mid either you make the game or break the game simple. 3rd Offlane you are the face of the frontline act like it. 4th Soft support you gotta make the plays with you team. 5th hard support you gotta protect your teammate even if it means sacrificing your life. Knowledge is power in this game knowing what to make at what time to make is very essential and crucial to the game.  The game community is not kind and sweet its a competitive game either you win or you lose no in between. The game offers you wide range of communication to use and communicate with your team please use it. The learning is very fun but once you know YOU KNOW. If you are veteran player guide the new ones and if you are new it will take time there is a lot of things to understand in this game and many things change after a big patch. Overall its a very competitive game that you can enjoy with your friends. Good Luck Laning ","baik"
"76561198181088699","Look, Dota is a Moba and I think people have a perception of Mobas (especially more well known ones) being toxic gaming environment for people who have nothing better to do with their lives. This perception is fair but I think Dota is great for a  few reasons that if you mesh with, great! Give the game a try. If you don't think any of these appeal to you, completely fair.  1. You live for the high of a game. A lot of the gameplay in Dota is nothing crazy. But every now and then you do a crazy play or sequence of events that as soon as it's over you're like ""What the fuck?! I can't believe I just did that!"" There can be different variations but while these moments are rare they feel incredible and can keep pushing you forward. If you're someone who wants a more consistent dopamine rush maybe not the best for you.  2. You love to see yourself improving. Not so much of a dopamine rush, but Dota has a stupid high skill ceiling. You can almost always see yourself slowly improving over time from last hitting, map awareness, itemization, drafting, and anything in between. It's a very satisfying but not exciting feeling that I enjoy and I think plays a big role into why I still play this game, and also why I don't consider these dopamine rushes. I will also take this chance to say as someone who's played both, I do think Dota is more difficult than Lol.  3. You have people play with. Yeah it's crazy huh? Turns out that if you're playing a multiplayer game, it's almost always more fun to have people to play the game with you. Hell, just having friends who you can talk about the game with makes it substantially more fun and engaging. It doesn't need to be friends starting the game at the same time as you but it's nice if you have a friend or group that wants to give it a try.   Overall, Dota is a frustrating but also rewarding game with a steep learning process. If you ever want to take the time to learn the ins and outs of a game then I highly recommend giving it a try.","baik"

"76561198027758678","I wandered into enemy territory like Dora the Explorer and got ganked into the afterlife. Would get ganked again :)  🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics 🎮 Dota 2 is mechanically deep. It's clear that once you understand its systems - items, roles, combos, counters - you can really shine. Even in just two matches, I could feel how high the skill ceiling is and how rewarding it might be with time. Abilities feel impactful, character movement is clean, and the variety of playable heroes is impressive.  That said, the gameplay felt overwhelming at first. Between map objectives, the item shop, and general combat flow, it throws a lot at you quickly. If you don’t already know what you’re doing or take time to study up, it’s easy to feel behind.  👀 Visuals & Aesthetic 👀 This part genuinely surprised me. Dota 2 looks great. It's clean, colourful, and less cluttered than other MOBAS I’ve tried. The UI is still packed with info, but the combat visuals are sharp. Animations are smooth, and the game feels polished across the board.  🧠 Learning Curve 🧠 I skipped the tutorial at first, and that was a mistake. My first match was rough - I didn’t understand the shop, my abilities, or what I was supposed to do. Once I went back and played the tutorial, I understood a lot more, but even then, it was clear that I’d need to put in several hours to play competently. This isn’t a quick, jump-in-and-go type of game. It’s meant for players who enjoy studying mechanics and improving over time.  🤝 Team Communication 🤝 This was a weak spot for me. I tried typing, and even calling things out in chat - but got almost no response. If you’re someone who values communication and team coordination, solo queue might feel a bit lifeless. Playing without friends made the whole experience feel more disconnected than I expected.  💰 Monetization 💰 No complaints here. There’s a huge selection of cosmetics, but they didn’t feel overpriced or aggressive. It feels like a game built for long-term investment, and the monetization reflects that in a fair way.  ✅ Final Verdict ✅ Dota 2 is a great game. It’s polished, smartly designed, and clearly built for people who want to invest real time into learning it. But for me, it’s just not the kind of game I enjoy long-term.  I respect it, I get the appeal, and I actually had fun with the chaos of learning. But I don’t see myself coming back to it. You'll probably love this if you’re into high-skill, team-focused strategy games and have the patience to learn. If not, you’ll bounce off it just like I did.","baik"

"76561198087359542","Dota 2: The Pinnacle of Competitive Game Design.  There are video games, and then there is Dota 2—a colossal masterpiece, a test of intellect, reflexes, teamwork, and strategic depth that remains unmatched in the gaming world. Born from the custom Warcraft III mod “Defense of the Ancients,” and nurtured into a full-fledged phenomenon by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 stands not merely as a game, but as a living, breathing arena of infinite possibility.    A Symphony of Complexity.  At its core, Dota 2 is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). Simple in premise, but what lies beneath is an ocean of interwoven mechanics, constantly shifting metas, and limitless skill expression.    Over 120 unique heroes, each with four or more abilities, synergies, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no templates here. Every hero is a universe.    Hundreds of items, each changing the dynamics of a fight, farm, or strategy. Itemization is not routine it's adaptive, reactionary, and highly situational.    No two matches are the same. The fog of war, real-time decision-making, unpredictable enemy movement, and the emergent behaviors of ten distinct human players mean that Dota 2 evolves every second, every game.    Where most games reward mechanical prowess or reflexes, Dota 2 demands it alongside macro knowledge, drafting intelligence, map awareness, timing, risk assessment, and an almost spiritual level of synergy with your teammates. It is chess with a pulse, and every move can echo into triumph or defeat.    No Pay to Win, All Skill.  One of Dota 2’s most defining traits is its purely skill-based model. Every hero is free. Every mechanic is transparent. There are no advantages sold—only cosmetics. Every victory is earned, every defeat is a lesson, and every player shares the exact same tools. The difference is in how you use them.    There is no hiding in Dota. Skill, knowledge, communication, and experience are laid bare in every move. This is why the game attracts the sharpest minds and most passionate players.    The Tactical Depth of a War Room.  Unlike many modern games that simplify gameplay loops to maximize appeal, Dota 2 embraces complexity—and the player base reveres it. Consider:    Drafting phase: Even before the game begins, the psychological warfare has started. Bans, picks, counters, combos—this is a metagame in itself.    Laning stage: Not just farming. It's about lane control, pulling, stacking, zoning, power spike timing, and reading the opponent's intent.    Mid to late game: It's a mental gauntlet. You think like a general. You calculate Roshan timings, smoke ganks, tower trade-offs, vision wars, cooldowns, buybacks, and split-push potential—all in real time.    Every decision can spiral the game in a different direction. Dota 2 does not reward random aggression it rewards calculated violence.    Community, History, and Esports Glory.  Dota 2 birthed The International, the most prestigious esports tournament in history—its prize pool funded directly by the community. TI finals are viewed by millions, not just for gameplay, but for the stories:    Underdog comebacks, Once-in-a-lifetime plays, Retirement runs and Cinderella moments    Legends are made on this battlefield. The community’s passion has kept the game evolving for over a decade, making it not just a game, but a shared mythos.    A Game That Grows With You.  Dota 2 has no ceiling. You can play for 10,000 hours and still learn something new. You become wiser, more disciplined, and more aware—not just in game, but in life. It teaches:    Patience (you will lose games for dumb mistakes)    Communication (you need to align five strangers into one unit)    Resilience (you will experience comebacks and heartbreaks)    Leadership and humility (sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow)    It sharpens your mind like few other digital experiences can. For those who crave mastery, Dota 2 is not just a game, it is a lifelong dojo.    Constantly Evolving, Yet Always Familiar.  Valve’s updates keep Dota alive, balancing nostalgia with innovation. From massive gameplay overhauls to subtle item tweaks, the game never stagnates. Patch notes are read like holy scripture, studied, debated, and then adapted to. It’s a cycle of rebirth every few months.    And yet, no matter how much it changes, Dota always feels like home. The radiant base. The dire cliffs. The pit where Roshan lives. These are etched in memory. It is your battlefield. Your proving ground.    Final Verdict: The Greatest Game Ever Made.  Dota 2 is art, science, sport, and strategy fused into one. It doesn’t coddle you. It demands your best, and it gives you the tools to find it. In a world increasingly defined by fast content and short attention spans, Dota 2 rewards depth, thought, and perseverance.    It may not be for everyone—but for those who seek the apex of digital competition, who dream of orchestrating five-man wombo combos and outplaying a whole team with one clutch move, Dota 2 is the undisputed throne.    It’s not just a game.    It’s the arena of gods.    Clan Doto Forever.    ","baik"

"76561198079429318","There really is no understating just how much of an enigma this game is. To try anyway, here's some fun facts.    1. Overall and for every year before 2020, this was THE highest payout eSport ever.    2. This game was the first game to have a Battle Pass, and it was done so much better than any other game as it funded the International ONLY. Yes, THIS game was the first.    3. This game STILL receives ""regular"" updates with both balance overhaul and game overhaul patches throughout each year.    4. Team play is EVERYTHING in this game. Yes, there will be those who sink in delusion and believe playing their own game 100% of the time is somehow what this game is for, but ANY contribution is critical. You could be the poorest hero on the map and still be a massive threat.    This game features highly affordable cosmetics, 140+ heroes with varying skill floors and ceilings, a both straight-foward yet highly complex item system, and matches that will virtually NEVER play out the same way.    This game is free. You don't have to buy heroes. Please, even if it seems hard, give it a shot. You will not regret it.","baik"
"76561198253291986","Dota 2 is a game I love… but it wears me down with endless updates and constant rebalancing.  I've spent many years with this game. I’ve seen ages pass, heroes rise and fall, items appear and vanish. Dota 2 is more than just a game — it’s a battlefield of minds and wills, where every match tells a story. You don’t just press buttons here — you live a full life in one evening.  But with the years comes a kind of fatigue. Not from the game itself — from the fact that it is never allowed to settle.  Just as you get into it, adapt, master a hero, and begin to truly enjoy the experience — everything changes again. Not just small tweaks — entire systems are torn apart and rebuilt. The heroes you knew like a friends becomes a strangers. The item that defined your strategy is gone. The meta you were finally beginning to understand — swept away.  In other games, updates feel like a celebration. Here, they often feel like grief. Each patch in Dota is like a dagger to the heart. They remove beloved skills, rewrite familiar mechanics, endlessly reshuffle the balance. It feels less like creative improvement and more like compulsive tinkering.  If updates were less frequent, they would be anticipated, even welcomed — not met with a tired sigh of ""Oh no, another patch… again? Seriously?"" And please, stop endlessly tuning the balance. Focus on things that don’t rewrite the foundations every time.  I understand — the game needs to live. But there’s a difference between life and restlessness.  This is a competitive game. This is E-sports. In sports, the rules don’t change every few weeks. Where is the stability? Where is the respect for the player’s time and learning? It often feels like the changes exist just for the sake of having changes — not because they’re needed.  To the developers, if you happen to read this — please, slow down! Don’t ruin what’s good in pursuit of something ""better."" Not every structure needs rebuilding. Not every system needs redesign.  Yes, we welcome new heroes. Yes, we love new items and seasonal content. But not every week or month. Let the game breathe. Let us live in it, not constantly study it.  P.S. Special thanks to whoever created the Turbo mode. For those of us with jobs, families, and a life outside of Dota — it’s a blessing. Turbo is like a short, joyful story before bed. Fast, fun, and without burnout.  I still love this game. I have, and maybe always will — unless one day it’s changed so much it stops being the game I once loved. But like any weary warrior, I ask not for more battles — I ask for a moment of rest between them… and for the rules to stop changing. Dota is a classic. It’s chess. Stop rewriting how the pieces move.","baik"
"76561198445331943","Classic game of strategy so complex that every update changes the game and the way it's played because of the buff/nerf-ment of heroes. Recently the game has introduced many new heroes and introduced many changes in items of heroes as well. I used to play it very often long time ago but recently started playing it again, back in the days the skins for the heroes were rare and expensive but now it seems that things are getting pretty cheap and you can get hero skins for a fraction of original prices.","baik"
"76561198261061047","Dota 2 is a legendary multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve. It features a 5v5 team format where each side aims to destroy the enemy base.  One of Dota 2’s strongest points is its depth and variety. The game has over 100 heroes, each with unique abilities and playstyles. This makes every match feel different and requires players to think strategically, work as a team, and react quickly.  The graphics and sound design are top-notch. The map is detailed, and the ability animations are visually pleasing. Regular updates from the developers bring balance changes, new heroes and items, and in-game events. Dota 2 also has a thriving esports scene — tournaments like The International attract millions of viewers and offer huge prize pools.  However, it’s worth noting that the game has a steep learning curve and can be unforgiving. New players may find it difficult to get into, and the community can sometimes be toxic. Also, matches tend to last 30–50 minutes on average, requiring focus and patience.  Pros: -Huge variety of heroes and items -Deep strategy and teamwork -Regular updates and support -Well-developed esports scene  Cons: -Steep learning curve for newcomers -Sometimes toxic community -Long match durations","baik"

"76561198030784015","This game has over 2.4 MILLION reviews and is mostly positive.   Seriously, with games like this there's not much else I can add to the vast body of reviews already explaining why the game is good.  Personally I've only written around 14,000 reviews, evaluating each game on it's own merits and the value proposition it offers compared to other games at similar prices.  Most of the reviews I write are negative, but most of the games that I give negative reviews to are widely ignored by gamers anyway, with only a handful of players in most cases.  Almost all the time, I'm just saying what other people think when they breeze on by and browse onto other games.  Gamers ignore bad games for a reason... and they pay attention to great games for good reason, too.  What I'm trying to say, is there's some wisdom in crowds, at least when it comes to games on Steam.  People don't play or even bother buying or downloading bad games.  But when 2.4 million people write a review for a game, it means they care about it.  There's something there.  The more players, the bigger it is.  This is definitely true for DOTA2.   One of the first in the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), DOTA (Defense of the Ancients) was a player-made map for Blizzard's Warcraft 3 RTS.  The map proved so popular that Valve decided to make a standalone sequel (with different mechanics of course) that proved to be one of the greatest competitive game formats known.  Part of the success is the expanded variability of NPC ""creeps"", low level soldiers that fight on your behalf, combined with rich player skill trees, adding completely new dimensions to the old RTS formula.  But I guess you don't need a history lesson.   There's a reason so many people have played this.  Because it's one of the greatest games of all time.","baik"

There is simply too many heroes, items and viable hero builds, that even in hour 700 you can still try something new and refreshing. But the biggest win for Dota 2 is the rare satisfaction in playing against highly skilled opponents, and still outwitting them and winning anyway. That's Dota 2 at its best.    Simultaneously, however, you will learn to hate yourself and everyone else. Your teammates will snap at you and each other more often than not. Internal drama, infighting, griefing, general toxicity and all the worst hallmarks of competitive online games.    If you do play, I recommend taking a month or two off every once in a while. Mental detox. Good for you.","baik"
"76561198367471798","Few games have shaped the esports landscape as profoundly as Dota 2. Developed by Valve, this free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) stands as a towering giant in competitive gaming—complex, rewarding, and fiercely strategic.  At its core, Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other in a battle to destroy the opposing team’s Ancient, a heavily guarded structure deep within their base. With over a hundred unique heroes, each boasting distinct abilities, playstyles, and roles, no two matches feel the same.  The game balances macromanagement of the battlefield with micromanagement of your hero’s growth—you’ll be farming gold, buying items, coordinating with teammates, ganking enemies, and executing game-changing team fights. It’s a demanding dance of skill, strategy, and split-second decision-making.  Dota 2 is notoriously complex. Its steep learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, but the depth is precisely what has kept the community thriving for years. Every patch introduces balance changes, new items, and sometimes new heroes, ensuring the meta continually evolves.  Mastering one hero, let alone the entire roster, requires time and dedication—but the satisfaction of outplaying an opponent or turning the tide in a crucial moment is unparalleled.  Visually, Dota 2 is colorful and detailed, with each hero uniquely animated and designed to stand out. The maps are richly textured, providing clear tactical information while remaining aesthetically pleasing. Sound design is top-notch, with distinct voice lines, spell effects, and ambient noises contributing to the immersive experience.  With one of the largest esports scenes globally, Dota 2’s The International tournament offers multi-million-dollar prize pools and draws millions of viewers worldwide. The community is passionate, vocal, and dedicated, though the competitive nature can sometimes lead to a steep social environment.  Dota 2 is a monument to strategic depth and player skill—a game that rewards patience, teamwork, and creativity. If you’re willing to invest the time, it offers a rich, endlessly evolving battlefield where every match is a new story.  Complex, competitive, and compelling—Dota 2 remains the pinnacle of MOBA excellence.  Rating: 9/10","baik"

Особенно радует, что игра постоянно развивается: разработчики регулярно добавляют новый контент, обновляют баланс и проводят крутые события. Атмосфера соревновательности и драйва заряжает энергией, а красивые визуальные эффекты и музыкальное сопровождение создают особое настроение.

"76561198043610692","Wonderful game! Great gameplay, great graphics, fun for hours and hours, it never gets old.   Message to devs:  You guys are doing a great job at retention, but the game would also greatly benefit from having more people play. For this, it needs to be more accessible to beginners, and casual players.  1- fix smurfing. Currently the main issue holding back the potential of the game in non ranked games (where casual players hang). Reporting is not enough, smurf accounts need to be banned, and IPs creating several smurf accounts need to be prevented to do so.  2- Improve beginners experience. The tutorial is good, but limiting playable heroes at start just creates frustration when new players can't play their favorite hero. Instead, have suggested heroes. Match making amongst players with 0 games or 0 victory is a must have (and of course coupled with the smurf fix above). Bots training is great but it's boring. It's very important to let beginners play with other beginners.  3- Skin quality. This is a much lower priority item, but it could really improve monetization. Many base models and old skins have really poor model/texture/etc. quality. The reward of receiving a random skin after a game is negated if said skin is so poor quality that it's not even worth equiping. Also, one of the stregth of Dota2 against competitors is the visual quality, so making sure all models have a consistent baseline quality, and staying coherent with the universe, is key to preserve and emphasize this strength.  Cheers!","baik"
"76561197985368010","This is not a casual game! Highly competitive.   If you have ever said ""It's just a game "" don't install it. Seriously.    This is not a simple game! If overly complex tactics and strategies are overwhelming. This game isn't for you.  There are a lot of variables, synergies, counters maneuvers, tactics etc to consider. There is a very large learning curve, many players do not reach the plateau of this curve , never mind the peak. The game is un-fun for people below this plateau. Imagine trying to play football without knowing what an offside, a field goal  or a punt is.   There are layers to understanding where a concept clicks and you think you understand, yet you are not seeing the bigger picture.  Football is considerably simpler but an analogy would be:  ""I am run ball, I am reach back, points is good, Don't get tackle. Sometimes I can throw, I'm master tactician""  -Most people     If you have a competitive heart and are prepared practice and fail to get better to achieve better skill expression this is one of the best games for that.    This is the original and best MOBA. I've played most of the big name competitors.  LOL can't match the depth and the strategy. HON being a clone did a good impression.  The game is a well executed strategic staple that will go down as one of the greats.    DOTA does have issues with the developers keeping their favorite heroes at the top of meta and keeping broken stuff in game because of fan noise also there are issues with rank assignment and smurfing in public games now that the game is older and less attention is paid to those kind of problems. These can be complex issues to solve and most games have similar issues.    TLDR  One of the best games ever, not for filthy casuals. Get good or move on.","baik"

And no, I don’t buy wards either I’m saving for a Blade Mail I’ll forget to use anyway.","baik"

One moment I’m a godlike Pangolier rolling through enemies, the next I’m questioning my life choices while watching my Ancient explode.  The game punishes mistakes brutally but rewards improvement like nothing else. Every match feels different — new heroes, item builds, weird meta picks, teammates who either carry you to glory or abandon you to chaos.  Mechanics? Tight. Depth? Insane. Community? A mix of Einstein and pure chaos. It’s stressful, frustrating, addictive, and somehow deeply satisfying. Once you start understanding how your decisions impact the whole team, it hooks you in for good.  🎮 Pros:  Deepest strategy and mechanical skill ceiling in any MOBA  Free to play, no pay-to-win  Constant updates and hero balance  Every win feels earned  💀 Cons: – Steep learning curve – Toxic players (you’ll meet plenty) – Matches can go from 10/10 fun to emotional damage real fast  ⚖️ Verdict: It’s not just a game — it’s a commitment. You don’t play Dota 2 casually Dota 2 plays you. Thumbs Up 👍 (289+ hrs of joy, pain, and questionable life choices)","baik"

"76561197967106364","Rating: 10/10 – The best ~200 hours I’ve spent being yelled at by strangers 🎮🔥    Dota 2 is not a game. It’s a lifestyle. A toxic, stressful, beautiful lifestyle full of betrayal 💔, triumph 🏆, and pinging the same spot on the map 🔁 until your teammates uninstall the game 💀.    👍 The Good:    🧙‍♂️ 124 heroes. Infinite strategies. Endless ways to throw a winning game at 50 minutes.    🤑 Free to play, no pay-to-win. Your wallet is safe. Your sanity? Not so much 😵.    🔄 Constant updates. One patch you’re a god, next patch you’re a walking meme.    🧘‍♂️ Winning a hard-fought game is better than therapy. Losing one... is therapy. (The kind that makes you cry in the shower 🚿😢)    👎 The Bad (But We Love It Anyway):    📉 Learning curve? More like a learning cliff. With spikes. On fire. 🔥🪨    🤡 Your teammates: either 5k MMR smurfs... or someone who installed the game 5 minutes ago on a toaster.    🙃 If you play support, prepare to be blamed for everything. Yes, even climate change 🌍🔥.    TLDR: Dota 2 is a beautiful, punishing, complex monster 👹 that gives nothing for free and demands everything. And yet... I keep coming back. Every. Single.

This game has taken every ounce of patience I had left. It has wrung me dry, stared into my soul, and whispered, “You could’ve just muted them, but you didn’t, did you?”    Every match begins with hope and ends with a philosophical crisis. One game I was a god — carrying my team like Moses parting the sea. The next? I died to jungle creeps and got flamed in five different languages, one of which I think was just Morse code insults tapped out in all-chat.    Dota 2 has singlehandedly made me question the future of humanity, the concept of teamwork, and why Timbersaw sounds so cheerful while murdering me.    And yet...  It's perfect.  It's beautiful.  It's the most satisfying, rewarding, high-skill, deep, toxic, glorious pit of digital agony I have ever willingly thrown myself into.    10/10. Would lose MMR and my sanity again.

Now, at the ancient age of 30+, I need to stretch before queueing, take deep breaths during draft, and book a therapy session after each loss.    Dota 2 is no longer just a game — it’s a test of emotional endurance, bladder control, and whether my old heart can handle a teammate insta-locking Techies in Divine bracket.    Ranked used to be about climbing. Now it’s about surviving.

You promise yourself never again—yet the taste lingers, and you return.  I play when I’m happy, when I’m broken, when my mind drowns in endless storms. This is not a game for soft hearts. It is for those who crave to feel, to bleed, to struggle, to conquer. For those who want to clash with others, raw and unfiltered, no masks, no censorship.  Dota 2 is not just a game.

"76561199811928673","I’ve been playing Dota since 2004, back when it was just a Warcraft mod. I’ve logged thousands of hours (though Steam doesn’t show it because I deleted my old account), and I’ve never really taken it competitively – for me, it’s all about fun and strategic chaos.  What draws me to Dota 2 is simple: almost infinite possibilities. Every match is different, demanding not just skill but also game knowledge and real-time strategy. It’s complex, challenging, and if you enjoy thinking, planning, and coordinating with a team, this game will feel like home.  Yes, the learning curve is steep. If you just want to click buttons and have easy fun, this might not be for you. But if you like to learn, test strategies, and feel part of something bigger… that’s where Dota shines.  One of my most memorable experiences was a 185-minute ranked match. I joined a team of strangers, and after nearly 3 hours, we left as friends. We won in the end, but the victory wasn’t the point: what really mattered was how we evolved as a team and built trust in such a short time. That’s what makes Dota 2 special.  Recommended for: anyone who enjoys strategy, teamwork, and challenges that don’t end in the first hour.","baik"
"76561199807404190","Dota 2 can feel really hard for new players at first. There are so many heroes, items, and strategies to learn. But after playing for a few weeks, everything starts to make sense. You begin to understand team coordination and hero roles better. The game becomes incredibly fun and rewarding.

The game gives you plenty of free rewards, you can usually unlock a couple skins of your choice a month with regular playing. I like that there isn't much gambling or any gacha mechanics it's really a breath of fresh air compared to similar games (league of legends)   Turbo is my favorite mode it's quick  - usually only lasting about 20 minutes per game - and fairly easy to get into queue (usually from 50 seconds to 2 minutes from what i've noticed.) despite the overall lower player count of this game.  8/10 game, could improve on its graphics and clarity, but otherwise the gameplay is very good an controls are well thought out.","baik"

"76561198147443087","After spending more than 2,000 hours in Dota 2, I can confidently say this game is a masterpiece of depth, strategy, and teamwork. Every match feels different—sometimes it’s a battle of skill, sometimes it’s about clever drafting, and sometimes it’s the thrill of clutch comebacks that keeps you hooked.  The hero pool is massive, offering endless combinations and playstyles. No two games are ever the same. The balance, while always evolving, shows how much care Valve puts into keeping the game competitive and fair.  What really sets Dota 2 apart is the intensity of every decision. A single mistake can cost the game, but a single moment of brilliance can turn the tide. It’s punishing, but in the most rewarding way.  Even after thousands of hours, I still learn new things every day. The community can be tough, but the satisfaction of playing with a coordinated team, pulling off perfect combos, or winning against all odds makes it worth it.  Dota 2 isn’t just a game—it’s an experience that challenges your mind, your patience, and your teamwork like nothing else.  Rating: 10/10 – A timeless competitive masterpiece.","baik"

This is not a game. This is a lifestyle, a cult, a psychological experiment conducted by ancient aliens using hats and MMR as bait.   🎮 Gameplay Experience:  Spent 25 minutes perfectly last-hitting in lane. Felt like a god.  Died once, and my carry typed “gg mid diff” and abandoned the game.  Next game I played support. Healed my team, warded, sacrificed everything.  Got blamed for us losing.  Next game I picked Pudge and missed every hook for 40 minutes.  Won. Got MVP. Team said I was ""the future of esports.""  I don't know what this game is anymore.   💀 The Dota Learning Curve:  1 hour: ""What’s a creep?""  10 hours: ""What’s a courier?""  100 hours: ""Why does everyone hate me?""  500 hours: ""I'm starting to understand this game.""  1,000 hours: ""Actually, I know nothing.""  2,000+ hours: ""I now understand quantum mechanics, but not why my team doesn’t buy detection.""   🧠 Heroes:  124+ heroes, each with unique skills and the power to ruin your day.  Want to be a literal fire god that burns everyone to ashes? Sure.  Want to play a rat with a teleport stick that destroys buildings while giggling? Go ahead.  Want to play a guy who throws trees and screams a lot? He’s in there.  Want to play a magical cow that charges across the map to punch someone once and then dies instantly? We got that too.   📉 MMR:  An ancient curse disguised as a number.  You win a few games, start to feel confident, and queue again.  Then matchmaking pairs you with Timothy, age 9, who locks in Techies and says ""I’m going mid"" in all-chat.  You lose 5 games in a row, uninstall the game, swear it off forever...  30 minutes later you're back, because ""this time it’ll be different.""  Spoiler: It’s not.   🎩 Cosmetics:  You can spend $200 on a sword that glows purple. It does nothing. It makes you feel nothing.  Until you see someone else with it—and suddenly, you need it.  Welcome to the Dota 2 economy, where digital hats are worth more than your car.   💡 Why Do I Still Play This Game?  Because no other game gives you:  The absolute high of a 5-man Echo Slam.  The existential dread of feeding first blood in a ranked match.  The pure poetry of a base race at 60 minutes.  The silent bond between teammates who’ve suffered together for 50 grueling minutes and still typed “gg wp” at the end.   🧘‍♂️ Final Thoughts:  Dota 2 is toxic. It’s brutal. It will test your patience, your reflexes, your friendships, and your keyboard’s durability.  It’s also a masterpiece—a game so complex, so deep, and so unforgiving that it becomes a lifelong challenge.  I don’t play Dota because I enjoy it. I play Dota because I must.  ⏳ 3000+ hours.

Эта игра – это как запихнуть себе в уши осиное гнездо, засунуть голову в микроволновку и при этом пытаться решать дифференциальные уравнения. Одна половина твоего тима – это овощи, которые только вчера узнали, что у мышки есть две кнопки. Вторая половина – это сбербанковские аналы, ушедшие в запой после того, как их жена забрала детей.

Ты видишь, как твой союзник первым пиком берет Керри, который последний раз был в мете лет пять назад, и ты уже понимаешь: всё, пиздец. Дальше можно не смотреть. Но ты смотришь. Потому что ты идиот.    Чат – это отдельный вид искусства. Это такая помойка, куда стекается вся ненависть этого мира. Там тебе расскажут, кого ебала твоя мамаша, какой ты бесполезный кусок говна, и обязательно посоветуют удалить игру.

And as a whole I might regret it but I won't, because this game partially made me the person who I'm now. So should you play this game? You need to decide yourself, but if you decide to play, be aware that it might devide your life on before and after.  p.s.  Thanks to Sergey, Daneil, Vadim, Ivan, Kostya, Vlad, Max and a lot of other people which name I forgot for participation in my jurney in this game and out of this game, I wish you all the best!","baik"

It seems like there often there are players that have high ranks but don't know how to play the game well. That should not be possible. The ranking should not just be based on winning or loosing a game, but in performance within the game. How did the player do compared to other team players.

The graphics? Divine. The gameplay? Complex. The teammates? A mix of gods, trolls, and exes. One game you're a king, next match you're a clown, And the carry's still farming while the throne burns down.  Valve, oh Valve, your patches confuse, You nerf fun things, and then buff Riki’s shoes. Aghanim’s Scepter now summons a cat? And Techies got reworked — who asked for that?  The queue time’s eternal, the flame wars are hot, My rank stays the same (though I swear I’m a god). The Russians yell “cyka,” the SEA kids throw, NA just picks Sniper — and feeds 10–0.  A MOBA of legends, a test of the soul, Where your sanity dies down in every role. But still I return, like a masochist champ, With coffee, regret, and a keyboard that’s damp.  So here’s my review: it’s a tragic affair, Of joy and of sorrow and pulling out hair.

"76561198088035833","One of the best games I have ever played. Constantly getting updates and additions to the game. Patches to balance the game are frequent. One of the most balanced games ever. The game has a steep learning curve and takes a lot of practice to get good.  The big issue I have with the game is the ranked system is way too dependent on wins and losses and performance of teammates. It is also very position dependent (mid/carry) and doesn't do a good job of evaluating someone's actually game play and impact on the game. You can have multiple games in a row where you are clearly the best player in the lobby and you lose and get penalized with a loss of rank,  forcing you to continue playing the same players/rank you are consistently better than. Solo queue in ranked is not very fun, lots of auto losses in the first 10 min due to someone feeding the game away. There needs to be a surrender option for a team, you can spend hours in 2-3 hours/games wasting time, waiting for the game to finish because the teams were so unevenly matched. There needs to be bigger punishments for people ruining games. Would just ask for a more impact based ranked system instead of a win or loss based.  Game has so many smurfs in it that if you get put in any of the lower ranks then you're not getting out, you can go 5+ games in a row with smurfs.","baik"

"76561198894202071","Dota 2 is the kind of game that makes me question my life choices every single time I hit that play button. The matchmaking feels like it has a personal grudge against me, teammates either go AFK, pick the most ridiculous heroes, or just decide it’s a good day to ruin my MMR. The game itself is ridiculously complicated too, like no matter how many hours I put in, there’s always some obscure mechanic or item interaction I had no idea even existed. It’s overwhelming, it’s punishing, and most of the time it feels like the game is laughing at me.    And yet, here I am, still playing it. Because every once in a while, everything lines up. The perfect teamfight breaks out, the clutch save comes in at the right second, or I land that skillshot I had no business landing. Those rare moments feel so good they completely erase the memory of the ten painful games that came before.

After a few years, they moved on to other games while I became more obsessed. Consistently, through big patches and drastic meta changes, it is the best designed, most brilliant MOBA. No matter their personality, a player can find their hero pool for their play style. Aggressive, passive, assassin, tank, support, manage tons of summons, whatever you like you can find a niche. Unfortunately, it takes a hundreds of hours just be competent. Player base can amazing or toxic, just the luck of the draw. Unfortunately, we are years past the glory days of TI. It is no longer the biggest prize pool in E-Sports. Valve squandered the opportunity to turn Dota into a true sport that non-players would watch.

"76561198309049558","Dota 2 is one of the most complex and rewarding competitive games ever created. With over a hundred unique heroes, endless strategies, and constantly evolving gameplay, every match feels fresh and different. The learning curve is steep, and it can be intimidating for new players, but the payoff is incredible once you start to understand the mechanics and teamwork required.  The graphics and animations are polished, and the regular updates keep the game balanced and exciting. Valve’s support through seasonal events and the yearly International tournament also adds to the game’s global community feel.  What truly makes Dota 2 stand out is the depth of strategy and the satisfaction of pulling off a well-coordinated team play. At the same time, it can be frustrating—games are long, mistakes are punishing, and toxic players do exist. But if you enjoy competitive, high-skill games with limitless replayability, Dota 2 delivers an experience few games can match.  ⭐ Rating: 4.5/5","baik"
"76561198100227357","If you're looking for an experience with more sophistication than League of Legends this game is exactly that.    The primary focus of the game is less direct despite both having the same win condition (destruction of enemy objectives). Instead of it being a test of purely mechanical skill, this game also tests game knowledge, team coordination, and awareness. I would place this game closer to RTS in nature than most MOBA contemporaries, which makes sense considering that real-time strategy is the etymology of the MOBA genre as a whole.    In short I play this and not League anymore because this is more entertaining. Not noobie friendly, requires dedication to learning.

"76561199865503134","Dota 2 is like a symphony where every player is a master conductor, their every move orchestrating a beautiful chaos of strategy, skill, and sheer willpower. It’s a realm where the thrill of the game flows like a river, sometimes calm and other times rushing at breakneck speed, but always keeping you on the edge of your seat.  Each match is a canvas, and the heroes are your paintbrushes. You’re not just playing a game you’re creating art in motion, one moment of brilliance at a time. Victory doesn’t come easy, but it’s the sweet reward of the effort, like the final note of a song that leaves you breathless.  The community is a powerful force—sometimes a storm, sometimes a breeze, but always adding layers to the experience. Every interaction, every new teammate or opponent, is like a spark that ignites something new and unexpected in the game. You never know what you’re going to face, and that unpredictability is part of the magic that keeps you coming back.  In Dota 2, you’re not just playing—you’re living the game.

"76561198233002780","Dota 2 Review: The Ultimate Love-Hate Relationship in Gaming  Where Chess Meets Chaos—and Your Sanity Goes to Die    1. Gameplay & Mechanics: A Symphony of Strategic Madness  • Unrivaled Depth: With 126 heroes (all free, no paywalls!) and 155+ items, every match unfolds like a dynamic chess match where pawns fire laser beams. Heroes range from a guitar-wielding minotaur (Spirit Breaker) to a time-bending dragon (Void Dragon), each with wildly unique abilities that synergize into thousands of viable strategies. The recent 7.39 update even added Facets—hero-specific trait customization—letting you morph a support into a carry mid-game.    • Map Mastery: Forget three-lane simplicity. Dota’s map is a tactical jungle with elevation mechanics (high ground = vision advantage), twin Roshan pits (boss monster relocates every 15 mins), and interactive objects like Wisdom Runes (XP boosts) and Lotus Pools (health/mana fruits). Jungling isn’t just killing creeps—it’s stacking camps (luring monsters to spawn extras) or blocking them with wards to sabotage enemy farms.    • Economy & Punishment: Gold loss on death? Check. Denying your own creeps to starve foes of XP? Check. Buybacks (pay to respawn instantly) that can bankrupt you? Double-check. This isn’t just resource management—it’s economic warfare where a single misclick can tilt a 50-minute game.    2. The Good: Why Dota 2 Is a Masterpiece  • Artistic Brilliance: Valve’s Source 2 engine delivers stunning visual clarity—every spell effect (e.g., Invoker’s sunstrike meteors) and hero model (e.g., Juggernaut’s Bladeform legacy) oozes polish. The free terrain skins (e.g., autumn forests, coral reefs) and 1,000+ community-made cosmetics (most under $1) let you turn heroes into steampunk pirates or disco divas.    • Tactical Freedom: Heroes defy rigid roles. A support Crystal Maiden can become a frost-nuking core with Aghanim’s Scepter. A carry Medusa can pivot into a tank with Shiva’s Guard. This flexibility fuels endless innovation—pro teams have used over 110 heroes in a single tournament meta.    • Spectator Paradise: The replay system tracks every cursor movement, skill build, and misplay, making it esports’ best learning tool. Watching TI (The International) finals feels like a blockbuster—$40M prize pools, Chinese teams reverse-sweeping Europeans, and crowd chants shaking arenas.    3. The Bad: Where Dota 2 Breaks Souls  • Vertical Learning Cliff: New players face three layers of hell:      1. Mechanical overload: Last-hitting while dodging Pudge hooks? Good luck.     2. Toxic tutors: 45% of matches feature flaming (e.g., ""uninstall, noob"") if you misplace a ward.     3. Steep mastery curve: It takes 200+ hours to grasp basics like pull timings or item counters. One wrong BKB (Black King Bar) activation? Congrats, you just fed the enemy carry.   • Snowball Suffering: Matches often spiral via ""rich get richer"" design. Lose the laning phase? Expect 20 more minutes of being chain-stunned by a farmed Phantom Assassin while teammates spam ""GG"" in chat.    • Addiction & Burnout: The average player logs 1,200+ hours—equivalent to reading War and Peace 15 times. Reddit threads are littered with cries: ""Help, I can’t stop playing!"" and ""Dota ruined my sleep schedule!"".    4. Community & Culture: The Double-Edged Sword  • Creative Utopia: The Workshop ecosystem birthed Dota Auto Chess (a genre pioneer) and absurd mods like Dota But Pokemon or CS:GO in Dota. Valve even canonizes fan designs—e.g., the ""Aegis of the Immortal"" shield became an official item.    • Toxicity Epidemic: Despite Behavior Scores (a karma system), 30% of games include griefers who:      • Pick Techies to mine allies’ jungle.      • Feed couriers (R.I.P. Gerald the llama) to enemies.      • Quote ""It’s just a game, why u heff to be mad?"" ironically.    5. Esports: Glory, Cash, and Heart Attacks  • The International (TI): Gaming’s Super Bowl + lottery jackpot. The 2023 prize pool hit $40M, funded by player-bought Battle Passes. TI moments are legendary:      • Chinese underdogs winning against 1% HP bases.      • ""The Play"": 5-hero wombo combos that break Twitch viewership records.    • Brutal Realities: Pro matches can last 5+ hours (see Azure Ray vs. G2.iG’s 334-minute marathon), demanding inhuman focus and bladder control.    Verdict: 9.5/10 – A Flawed Masterpiece  Pros Cons 🤯 Infinite replayability with meta-shaking updates 📉 Soul-crushing learning curve 🎨 Stunning art + free cosmetic economy 💀 Toxic community (mute button = MVP) ♟️ Unmatched strategic depth ⏳ Matches = time黑洞 (avg. 45 mins) 🏆 Epic esports with life-changing prizes ❄️ Snowballing defeats feel hopeless     Final Wisdom:    ""Dota 2 is like a toxic marriage: 90% suffering, 10% euphoria… and somehow you keep coming back for more."" Play it for the strategy nirvana, stay for the TI hype—but pack patience, mute buttons, and therapy funds.    ","baik"

"76561198792509611","Dota 2: A Timeless Strategy Masterpiece  Dota 2, developed by Valve, remains one of the most compelling and complex MOBAs on the market. Its gameplay is a finely tuned balance of strategy, teamwork, and individual skill, offering a depth that few games can rival. The core mechanics—hero selection, laning, itemization, and map control—create an intricate web of decision-making where every choice can significantly impact the outcome of the match.  One of Dota 2’s most remarkable aspects is its hero diversity, with over 120 heroes, each possessing unique abilities and playstyles. This diversity ensures that no two games are ever the same, challenging players to adapt constantly. Furthermore, the game rewards strategic synergy, both in hero composition and in real-time coordination, emphasizing communication and foresight.  The metagame in Dota 2 evolves continuously, driven by patches and professional tournaments. This constant evolution keeps high-level play fresh and encourages players to refine their skills perpetually. The learning curve is steep, which may intimidate newcomers, but for those willing to invest time, the depth of mastery is immensely satisfying.  Graphically, Dota 2 delivers a visually appealing experience without compromising performance, making it accessible across a wide range of hardware. The sound design, from hero voice lines to environmental cues, adds layers of tactical feedback and immersion.  In conclusion, Dota 2 is not just a game—it’s a strategic battleground that rewards intelligence, teamwork, and adaptability. Its complexity is both its greatest strength and its challenge, creating a competitive experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is thrilling. For players seeking a game that combines strategic depth with competitive intensity, Dota 2 remains unmatched.  Score: 9.5/10","baik"

"76561198913752431","Dota 2 is an incredibly captivating and unique game that delivers tons of emotions and pure adrenaline. The atmosphere of team battles, deep strategy, variety of heroes, and the feeling of victory after a tough match all create an experience that’s hard to find elsewhere.  At the same time, this game can really drain your nerves. Dota 2 is highly emotional: one mistake can cost you the entire match, and the team dynamics can sometimes be more exhausting than the gameplay itself. Often, you finish a match feeling like you’ve worked a full shift.  Overall, Dota 2 is a game of contrasts: it brings both immense joy and serious stress. If you’re ready for an emotional rollercoaster, it’s one of the best choices among team-based online games.","baik"

I thrive in the role of enabling my team, securing vision, protecting cores, and making clutch saves that can turn the tide of a game. Playing support has taught me the importance of map awareness, resource efficiency, and strong communication. I take pride in reading the flow of the game, knowing when to sacrifice and when to step up.  Support might not always get the spotlight, but for me, it's where the game is won — through foresight, discipline, and making the team shine. Dota 2 has been as much a mental challenge as it has been a test of teamwork and patience, and I’ve loved every moment of it.","baik"

"76561198254728144","I’ve played a lot of games, but Dota 2 hits differently. It’s not just a game—it’s a mix of frustration, adrenaline, and pure satisfaction.    When I first started, I honestly felt lost. The mechanics, items, and hero skills were overwhelming. One mistake could cost the whole team, and that pressure was tough. But over time, I realized that’s exactly what makes Dota 2 special. Every match is unique, every hero is different, and every decision matters.    The best part for me is the teamwork and strategy. When my squad coordinates well—pulling off a perfect gank or clutch defense—it feels like magic. Of course, not every game is perfect. The toxicity is real, and matches can drag on for an hour. But when you finally win after a hard-fought battle, the victory is way more rewarding than most games I’ve played.    I also love the esports side of Dota 2. Watching The International and seeing pro players pull off insane plays makes me want to grind and improve.    For me, Dota 2 is more than just a hobby—it’s a challenge that keeps me coming back.

"76561198078647508","Dota 2 – The Game I Hate to Love ❤️💔    Dota 2 will ruin your mood, test your patience, and drain your free time... and somehow, you’ll keep coming back.    No pay-to-win, just pure skill, strategy, and stress. Every match is a mental chess game with fireworks — one second you're a god, the next you're reported by 4 strangers.    🔥 1000+ hours in, and I’m still learning.  💀 I’ve uninstalled more times than I’d like to admit.  😢 No Battle Pass this year? Huge letdown. The magic just isn’t the same without it.    But when that perfect teamfight hits, when you carry with 10 HP, or land the game-winning spell... nothing else compares.    Play Dota 2 — just don’t say I didn’t warn you.","baik"

You will spend 30 minutes carefully farming creeps, only to die in 0.2 seconds because you forgot the enemy support bought dust. Don’t worry, your team will politely remind you by typing “report” 47 times.  Winning feels incredible. Losing feels inevitable. But no matter what, you queue again.

The game can feel overwhelming at times, but when you get into the flow, it’s genuinely fun and rewarding.  That being said, the player community can be hit or miss. Sometimes you meet friendly, helpful teammates who make the game even better, but other times… let’s just say the atmosphere can be less than welcoming. As a casual player, this can be discouraging, especially when you’re just trying to enjoy the game.

"76561198322379889","Dota 2 is one of the most rewarding and punishing team-based competitive games ever made. With its staggering depth, relentless learning curve, and fiercely balanced free-to-play model, it demands dedication but offers unmatched strategic variety. Rooted in its origins as a mod for Warcraft III, Dota 2 has evolved into a complex multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) that requires significant time and effort to master.    A Trial by Fire  New players face a brutal introduction: over 100 heroes, intricate mechanics, and a meta that shifts with every patch. Early matches can feel overwhelming, but perseverance reveals a brilliantly layered game where knowledge and teamwork trump reflexes alone. Key mechanics include:    Denying: Players can kill their own creeps (AI units) to prevent enemies from gaining experience and gold. This strategic move is crucial for controlling the lane and starving opponents.    Hero Roles: Understanding hero roles is vital. For instance, hypercarry heroes scale well into the late game, becoming powerful threats, while soft supports provide utility and vision without needing much gold. In contrast, strong supports can initiate fights and protect carries, ensuring they survive to deal damage.    Lanes: The game features three main lanes: top, middle (mid), and bottom. The mid lane is often contested for its central position, allowing heroes to gain experience quickly and rotate to assist other lanes.    Pure, Uncompromising Balance  Valve’s commitment to fairness is unmatched—every hero is free, and only cosmetics are monetized. This focus on skill fosters a competitive purity that is rare in free-to-play titles. Players must learn intricate mechanics, hero interactions, and strategies to succeed, making skill and teamwork paramount.    A Living, Evolving Game  Regular updates, pro-level spectating, and community-driven content keep Dota 2 fresh. While some design choices feel outdated, such as finicky tower targeting, Valve’s polish and anti-toxicity measures make the game more welcoming than ever—though playing with friends remains the best experience.    Game Mechanics Overview  Vision: Control of vision is critical in Dota 2. Players use wards to gain sight over key areas, allowing for strategic positioning and ambushes. Proper vision can turn the tide of battles and prevent ganks.    Itemization: With numerous items available, players must adapt their builds based on the game state and enemy heroes. Items can enhance stats, provide active abilities, or counter specific threats, adding another layer of strategy.    Team Composition: Successful teams often balance their composition with a mix of damage dealers, supports, and initiators. Understanding how these roles interact is essential for executing strategies effectively.    Dota 2 isn’t for casual players it requires a significant time investment to enjoy fully. However, for those willing to climb its steep learning curve, it delivers endless depth, adrenaline-pumping matches, and a fiercely fair competitive landscape. A masterpiece of the genre—if you dare to master it. May the best team win!","baik"

"76561198035853026","Love Dota 2. It has so much depth and complexity. At first, I was turned off by the idea that it would take me possibly 100s of hours to learn it, but after playing a few games, I did start to understand it. As a former League of Legends player, I can grasp the moba fundamentals in Dota 2 easily, however there are significant differences between the two.   Dota 2 may seem slower, but man, wait till you get flash ganked by an Earthshaker and perma-stunned then 0-100 in a couple of seconds. There is fight commitment here, and the visuals are excellent. It also doesn't have many skill shots, so positioning and strategy is key. Another fundamental difference is that most items are not passive stat sticks, they do provide stats but also come with game changing actives, that can dictate the flow of combat. It is quite possibly the most glaring difference between Dota 2 and LOL. In Dota 2, we buy items for extra abilities essentially.  All-in-all I'm loving the game so far, i.e., 40 hours in. <b> Rating 95/100. </b>","baik"

When you play with friends, especially a full 5-stack, the game can be pure magic — coordinated fights, smart plays, actual teamwork. It’s one of the most satisfying multiplayer experiences out there.  But... if you're playing solo, good luck. Dota 2’s community is infamous for a reason. Expect fragile egos, instant blame, rage picks, and people who think they’re the next Miracle after getting one triple kill. Playing solo queue is like flipping a coin — maybe you get a decent team, or maybe you're stuck with a keyboard warrior screaming in chat and griefing from 10 minutes in.

The hero diversity, gameplay mechanics, and regular updates make it a standout experience among competitive games.  However, I would like to respectfully share some concerns regarding the current state of matchmaking—particularly on the Asia server. Lately, I’ve noticed that the matchmaking quality has significantly declined, leading to unbalanced games, long queue times, and frequent mismatches in player skill levels. This can be discouraging, especially when you're trying to enjoy a fair and competitive environment.  I understand the challenges involved in maintaining a global matchmaking system, and I appreciate the effort the developers put in. Still, I hope the team can look into improving matchmaking fairness and consistency in the Asia region. A more balanced system would greatly enhance the experience for players who are passionate about the game.  Thank you for your continued work on Dota 2.

Valve likes money and if a person is willing to swipe for an account/account boost they are most likely going to be willing to sub to DotA+ and buy skins.  DotA+ is another very big bait in my opinion depending on what you're buying it for. I bought it only for the predicted match quality and the ability to avoid people. Most of the games that had ""Ideal"" predicted match quality ended up in a hard one-sided stomp.  The game itself is amazing but it has become cancer to play due to an insane amount of people playing the game at a certain rank who do not belong there and just waste everybody else's time.

"76561198120223786","Negative Review of Dota 2    Dota 2 is one of the most overrated and toxic games I have ever encountered. Despite years of existence and Valve’s enormous resources, the game remains incredibly frustrating, mentally exhausting, and often unfair in every possible way.    1. Terrible Community  One of the main reasons people quit Dota 2 is its community. It is truly toxic: in almost every game, there is at least one player who either deliberately ruins the match or insults the entire team. The report system is practically useless—griefers and toxic players go unpunished, while you can get muted just for asking your team to play cooperatively.    2. Extremely High Learning Curve  Even if you want to learn the game, are willing to invest time, and try to understand the mechanics, Dota 2 doesn’t make it easy for you. There is no proper tutorial, and the sheer amount of information you need to memorize is overwhelming. Moreover, even if you become a skilled player, that doesn’t mean you’ll win—too much depends on teammates and pure luck.    3. Balance is a Myth  Heroes are either too strong or completely useless. Every patch shifts the meta so drastically that you have to relearn everything. Some heroes stay unplayable for months, making it pointless to invest time mastering them, as they may become irrelevant in just a couple of updates.    4. Matchmaking is a Lottery  The ranking system in Dota 2 is another source of frustration. Matchmaking works in such a way that sometimes you get a team that plays perfectly, and sometimes you get players who have no understanding of the game’s basics. There is no balance between teams, and your wins or losses are more dependent on luck than skill.    5. A Waste of Time  To make any real progress, you need to invest hundreds of hours, yet even after that, you won’t necessarily enjoy the game. Every match is either stressful or disappointing, and the feeling of satisfaction is extremely rare.    Conclusion  Dota 2 may seem interesting at first, but in reality, it drains your time, nerves, and energy. It is a game for those who are willing to endure toxicity, unbalanced mechanics, and frustration. If you’re looking for fun, it’s best to stay far away from this chaos.","buruk"
"76561198120649165","Maybe time to say goodbye.   Dota 2 is the best competitive game you can find right now, unbeatable in its genre. Unfortunately it also has the most toxic player base in the gaming industry by a huge margin. It's almost impossible to play a whole game without at least one player goes on a tantrum for absolutely no reason and ruin the match for everyone. Playing Dota is a long streak of frustrations, disappointments, insults and disruptive behaviors with sprinkles of fun and satisfaction here and there. After more than a decade of getting on and off, as time goes by I can see more and more clearly how mentally unhealthy the whole experience is, and today I finally made the decision to not return.

"76561198047333591","Impressions are purely based on nearly 200 unranked games, but by god is Dota 2 one brilliant video game with one incompetent developer and millions of players who don't deserve access to anything made after 19th century.  I wish I could enjoy it because the actual game part is brilliant. It quite the first of its kind, but it definitely defined and popularized it, and it's easy to see why. They took the fun of hero characters in RTS games, amplified it tenfold, and then built a whole game around it. Every match you have a lot of decisions to make that vary drastically based on the state of the game, team compositions, economy, individual player builds and playstyles, etc. Even the characters themselves are so diverse, and I think this is the biggest leg up it has over the competition. Gameplay itself can shift so much from character to character that it's almost understandable why some sickos pick one flavor and the eat nothing but that for thousands of hours.  It's also an almost paradoxical game where both hero and system overall enable a great amount of skill expression, yet proper teamwork and coordination are still important to an extent that you rarely actually see in team based multiplayer games. It's also one game where ""nobody is broken when everyone is"" really does feel accurate. In the right hands and with the right items, pretty much every character can do things that will make you think ""well, that's some bull****,"" yet there is often a powerful counter to it, a way to play around it, or something equally bull that every other character can pull off. Dota 2 *feels* loose in every element of its design, yet when you look closer at any of those elements, you start seeing thin but unbreakable connection that weave the fabric that Dota is made of.  Even in terms of visuals and storytelling I like more about it than I would expect from a MOBA. There's a lot of lore to explore, and while much of it is lacking, and Valve is sort of just sitting on it, it feels like whoever is responsible for putting it all together still cares deeply about the universe that this game is set it, and Crownfall is hopefully first of many examples of what can be done with it.   The only caveat here is that Valve also has some of the soulless, greediest monetization practices, and very low standards for maintaining the visual integrity of the games they created. All the fine craftsmanship that was put into creating the art style of TF2 was smeared with crap once lootbox money started rolling in. CS mostly resisted this, because cosmetics used to be limited to only weapons, but Dota 2 art style also went down the drain. Anything is permitted, and the more offensively tasteless it looks, the more rare and expensive it is.   The base characters all have their charm in some way. I understand that they aren't to everyone's taste. Many of them lack maybe one or two features that would make them feel like a ""main character,"" which is something that I feel a lot of hero based games chase after. All of them are just a bit too plain or simple to fit that role. You have dozens of dudes in armor of various colors and sizes, but it weirdly appeals to me that no individual character feels too ""special"" I guess?   That was all thrown out the moment Valve smelled money. Now you can spend an unreasonable amount of money in order to turn your unremarkable mook into a high level MU Online whale. It's funny because Valve still has those brilliant cosmetics guidelines for people who want to make something, but they haven't cares about what is said there for years. Silhouettes? Who cares. Glance value? Dude, just remember that this pile of pixels is Sniper. The arcanas are especially offensive, because they advertise extra crap as a selling point. Most Dota 2 chars emit zero lights or particles, some sets will give you clouds, glowing gems, arcs of lightning, buzzling flies or orbiting stars, excess is the goal over something coherent or appealing, and the community happily eats it up. Perhaps they don't even care about the look, since all of this is connected to the real money marketplace that enables gambling addicts, whales, and kids who think they can make money by playing their favorite video game.  Anyway, Valve happily enabling gambling aside, one of the main things that makes this game harder to enjoy is the quality of matchmaking and moderation. I have a succesful griefing report for pretty much every single day that I played, and to give you an idea, that doesn't even include a case where we had a willow that stood AFK in the fountain and sent our her courier to die, I guess that didn't count or something. Griefers would be one thing, but there's also so many accounts that are merely days old but obviously aren't remotely new to Dota. If it all it takes to avoid smurf que is to occasionally throw a game, then I'm not sure Valve understands the point of smurf que. Finally even ignoring these two points that already ruin 90% of my matches, the game loves to put new and old players together. I don't care if MMR is similar, a Zeus with 12k wins will be stronger than (non-smurfing) Zeus qith 20 games under their belt, it makes no sense to not take player count into account.  Maybe ranked would've resolved some of my woes, but you need 100 in-game hours to even gain access to that. It took me well over 150 matches to get to that point. I'm not sure if Dota players understand this, but the point of ranked isn't just to stroke your ego and to achieve the highest number/icon possible. It's there to enable fair matches between equally matched opponents. If someone is new and bad, they will be put up against other new and bad players, that's good.  ""But it keeps smurfs out"" please reconsider even attempting to think that this makes sense. More dedicated smurfs are buying accounts and paying boosters to get whatever they want, Valve is exceptionally bad at handling that too. More stingy ones are then thrown into unranked with players who could've been playing ranked, and I'm not sure too many of them are willing to endure low quality matches for 100 hours before they are allowed to experience something more tolerable. It's really a shame. Under more caring developer, Dota 2 could've been a fantastic experience.","buruk"

"76561199066939221","I have never played a game less friendly towards beginners than this. As much as I want to learn to play it I don't feel like spending hundreds of hours studying every hero and their abilities just to end up being deleted by a person who has played hundred times longer than you while simultaneously being told to end my days in a language I couldn't understand until starting this game. Everything is overwhelming and you don't have time to figure anything out before being thrown into a game. There doesn't seem to be a way to queue for a specific role or if there is I'm too stupid to find it so when you get in a game you have no idea which role you are expected to play while also some of the heroes not being available to you despite them being an option in ""new player mode"" (for example Muerta). There are so many features and the game is incredibly complex, but almost none of it is explained so you end up watching hours of tutorials to get the most basic grasp on it.   I prefer the overall design to LoL and would much rather play this one over it, but I feel like the only way to get into it as a new person is to have a friend who has played it for years and can teach you while playing with you.    My internet disconnected for a few seconds while playing and after rejoining the match, nothing seemed to move despite waiting for a couple of minutes. Only thing that helped was closing the entire game and restarting it to be able to join that match and afterwards I was given a punishment for ""abandoning"" the game. On paper this game is incredible, but the experience of being thrown into a match as a new player with only seconds to make all the decisions needed is so horrible that I am seriously considering downloading League again despite being cancer-free for a few years now.","buruk"
"76561197985917751","This game has accumulated too much unnecessary visual noise. I would not recommend this game to anyone new. Maybe if there was an option which could toggle the superfluous cosmetics, it would be less overwhelming to distinguish what is what.","buruk"
"76561199189051136","The Most Miserable Masterpiece Ever Made    Dota 2: The Most Miserable Masterpiece Ever Made    Dota 2 is less of a game and more of an elaborate psychological torture chamber disguised as entertainment. It’s a 5v5 strategy MOBA where, in theory, you pick heroes, farm gold, destroy towers, and eventually the enemy Ancient. In practice, you spend most of your time questioning your life choices while being insulted by strangers from six different countries simultaneously.    Gameplay – or why fun is illegal  The game is technically deep — 124 heroes, hundreds of items, thousands of possible interactions. But here’s the catch: it’s only fun for the first 0.01% of players who have mastered every single mechanic. For everyone else, it’s a constant state of being too weak to matter or too dead to play. Matches last an average of 35–50 minutes, which sounds fine until you realize you can lose in the first five and still be forced to sit there for the rest of the match pretending you have hope.    The Learning Curve – shaped like a cliff  Most games ease you in. Dota 2 hands you a rope, tells you to climb, and then sets the rope on fire. The tutorial teaches you how to move and buy a single item — then drops you into games where you’re expected to instantly understand last-hitting, creep aggro, stacking camps, ward placement, map awareness, item timing, power spikes, counterpicks, and at least 20 hero-specific mechanics.    The Community – a global anthology of toxicity  If the United Nations wanted a case study in human hostility, Dota 2’s voice chat logs would be the first thing they open. Teammates will flame you for playing badly, for playing well, for picking the wrong hero, or for existing at all. You’ll get blamed for losses you didn’t cause and rarely thanked for wins you carried. Mute buttons exist, but that only stops the words — the ping spam will still haunt you.    Matchmaking – where dreams go to die  Valve’s matchmaker feels like it was coded by a dice-rolling raccoon. One game you’ll have coordinated teammates, the next you’ll have someone who just discovered WASD. There’s nothing like getting matched with a first-time player on Techies when you’re up against a 6,000 MMR stack.    The Meta – a constantly shifting nightmare  Every patch flips the entire game upside down. One month your favorite hero is an unstoppable powerhouse, the next they feel like a wet noodle. Learn one strategy? Too bad — it’s obsolete by the next Tuesday.    Graphics & Sound – fine, but irrelevant  Yes, the game looks good. Yes, the sound design is sharp. But when you’re on a 50-second death timer because you got one-shot by a hero you didn’t even see on your screen, you won’t care about the pretty trees or the satisfying crit sound.    The Addiction Loop – your worst habit in disguise  The most diabolical part of Dota 2 is that it keeps tricking you into coming back. You’ll swear you’re done after a soul-crushing loss, but then you think, “One more game. I can win this time.” Then it’s 3 AM, your eyes hurt, and you’ve gained nothing but a deeper sense of regret.    Conclusion – a perfectly balanced disaster  Dota 2 is a masterclass in game design and a masterclass in ruining your mood. It’s the kind of game that can give you the best match of your life and the worst match of your life in the same evening. If you value your sanity, your free time, or your blood pressure, stay away. If you do play, you’ve either accepted the suffering… or you’re too far gone to notice anymore.    Final Score: 2/10 — “Technically brilliant, emotionally bankrupt.","buruk"

"76561198027808762","This guy is spot on. He only has 15k hours because he fell into the trap like countless others and many more will in the future.  The game is literally designed to create addiction and fuel their monthly battle pass subscription service. Hackers run rampant and if you somehow overcome the odds and begin to win, the game studies you, adapts, and then overcomes you.  How does it overcome you? Many ways, let's name a few: Opponents cheat, your team are bots, you play on ""North America"" server but all your team are from foreign lands speaking everything but English, your team are toxic/griefers, the mmr is hidden and pairs you with wide ""skill"" gap teammates vs Seal Team 6.  Let's examine some red flags: The worst and best players in dota vary in winrate from 46 percent to 54 percent until you hit your ""true"" mmr!  Watch people use their ""mmr"" as some kind of badge or medal defining their worth while seamlessly making plays worse than any ""Herald"" low rank player you've ever seen. Be a scientist and run an experiment: Spend money and watch your ""winrate"" suddenly go up!  Still not convinced? Watch your favorite streamers get secret algorithm boosts from the developers so they can ""win"" but we all know if they were in the matches you face on your account, even the ""pros"" couldn't win. Doubt me? Tell me how you win when your team runs down middle and feeds as soon as they respawn because you didn't play the way ""they want"" or because they lost their last game and now you must suffer 2 or you defeated them in the previous game and now they will make sure you lose.  Let's find a solution! Simply put them on your avoid list right? But wait! You are limited on the amount of ""avoid"" slots even with the subscription service.  How about mute your team? Enjoy playing a ""team game"" requiring communication on silent mode.  How about communicate with your team? Watch them mute you faster than you can say ""Cash or Credit.""   ""Free To Play"" has and always will be a keyword for ""Pay To Win"" and ""Hackers Paradise"".  Even ""pro teams"" can't beat ""AI"" artificial intelligence.  Look up ""Open AI defeats OG"" on youtube from 6 years ago for any ""haters"" or ""doubters"" of what I'm saying. Better yet, look up ""Dota 2 Tips hackers"" and you will find a plethora of dota 2 cheats and cheaters.  For the longest time people ran with the mantle of ""hacks don't exist"" in dota or ""it's about skill"" while they ""360 headshot"" you and laugh. Anyone still remember ""Liver King Claims To Be Natty""? Or how about Clintons ""I did not sleep with that woman! Ms. Lewinski!"".  The developers don't care about any of us, simply about making money. The game was never about skill or any other ""keywords"" they use to trigger you with. It was and always will be simply a source of endless revenue for a company ""Valve"" that simply doesn't care but they can and will keep you coming back because ""things are different now"".  They know we can't stop them and they can and will continue to treat us like the cash cows we are. This game owes you nothing but they can and will steal everything from you if you let them.  When you get called an idiot in dota or any other game just take a deep breathe and imagine the anonymous idiot behind a computer screen being a keyboard warrior with his paid actor ""friends"" ganging up on you because they don't want to be the next target.  One look at your President of Valve Corporation ""Lord Gaben"" or his ""net worth"" should tell you all you need to know about ""Valve"" and their so called ""ethics"".  If you get on his nice list maybe he will even give you an ""Immortal"" high rank account for free so you 2 can look and act like a ""pro"" 2.  If you read nothing else just do this: Find a guy/girl you like and tell them how important a video game called ""Dota 2"" is to you and how much time you've ""invested"". When they leave you proceed to ask them back by telling them how big your ""mmr"" is. See if it works and get back to me. Have a great day! :steamsalty::steamthumbsup:","buruk"

""Get good"" does not apply here when the games are outright rigged. How are you supposed to turn games around when three of your teammates are feeding 0:10 and your opponent is at 10:0 at 10 mins?

"76561199261524308","I used to love this game, I've been playing since the original DOTA (on Warcraft 3 [Custom Game]). However, recently the game has become substantially worse, rife with toxic behavior from people who believe they know how to play the game, but unfortunately do not. Recently, I've had people curse me out calling me every name under the sun, simply for correcting them about a mistake they made with regards to the rules of making a report, or how the game is traditionally played. Sometimes the players will just shut down completely, (I'm being cordial and kind the entire time, mind you.) so they start talking over me every time I try to talk, not letting me get a word in edgewise. At that point I may simply call them a ""noob"" they report me and then somehow I get my behavior score lowered, even though they were the one harassing me and going utterly ballistic in the first place. I find this to be completely ridiculous. Most people cannot take constructive criticism or advice in this game, they almost ALWAYS take it personally. Also, there are some EXTREME imbalances in the game, where characters such as Warlock, Windranger, and Juggernaught can simply plow through nearly an entire team by themselves, due to their outrageously overpowered ultimate abilities. This game needs some SERIOUS reworking.  As if all of that wasn't bad enough, There is a disconnect on nearly 2/3 games now, meaning you typically have to start at least 3 different games just to get one that you may be actually be able to play through to the finish, without someone disconnecting. I've even disconnected several times myself, and I know that it's not my internet causing the issue because I haven't disconnected from the internet at all. This has become a constant.

It's supposed to be a team game but about 90% of the time you are queued with toxic players who either troll and throw the game or who immediately attack you on voice/chat.  Players should be mandated to take a communication course before being allowed to play ranked games, but instead Valve allows this toxic community to flourish and the innocent receive vindictive reports and banishment.

And he awards you with -1000 conduct score, and gives you 24h ban. You cant do shit about it, u cant complain, you cant force someone to check replay and actually see who the ruiner is. This is just one small example of how trash this community is.  Idk why Volvo did that.

"76561199817761730","Доброго времени суток уважаемые игроки Dota 2. Нет желания кому-то доказывать, или оправдывать чье-либо мнение. Комментарий сугубо больше для себя для закрепления опыта в данной сфере. В игре будучи с 2025 года и 15 января, я наиграла более 1000 матчей, подняв 1700+ ммр в рейтинге (большая часть в Allpick). За все это время в доте можно ощутить и увидеть весь спектр эмоций, большая часть из которых негативная. Придя сюда увлеченной игрой с человеком и после игры без него, дота не принесла ничего кроме негативных и пустых эмоций. Игра пустая с однообразным геймплеем и тратой времени более чем на час, а бывало и полтора. Ради чего? Ради 25 ПТС. В доте я была активным и достаточно порядочным игроком чтобы оставаться в тени наблюдателем. Люди последними грязными словами кроют в этой игре, желают смерти, кидают угрозы. Те кто имеет другой ранг дабы самоутвердиться готовы низко пасть чтобы удовлетворить свою неполноценность. Люди растеряли свою честь в компьютерной игре, и с пенной у рта готовы грызть друг друга. И вся дота как посев надежды, лотерея. Большая часть игроков никогда не станет известными или не будет участвовать в больших играх, фигурируя как известные крутые команды и тп, они застрянут на своем рейтинге 2к и не сдвинутся. Для игроков это не просто уже способ побега от реальности, а способ укрыться и скоротать время. Но годы идут, мы взрослеем и отдаем лучшие годы впустую. Можно вставить 5 копеек и сказать - Не все такие! Я играю в меру!. Конечно! Мера - есть, но не все ее соблюдают.   Я не рекомендую сюда заходить игрокам которых интересует нормальный геймплей, сугубо сосредоточенный на игре, а не на личностях что смеют оскорблять, ведь даже если таким людям дать ответ они его не поймут. Другой сорт. Моей руки больше в игре этой не будет. Удачи людям в игровом мире. Игры приносят пользу, и иногда даже помогают, но они также могут нанести и вред, если ты далеко в них заходишь.","buruk"

"76561198035064386","As a long-time Dota 2 player since 2013, I’ve witnessed the game evolve—but not always for the better. While the core gameplay remains engaging, Valve’s approach to matchmaking and MMR has become increasingly frustrating, to the point where it feels like the system is actively working against you rather than facilitating fair competition.  -The biggest issue with Dota 2’s ranked system is its apparent forced 50% win rate mechanic. No matter how well you play, the game seems determined to keep you at a certain MMR range by stacking the odds against you, even if you’re a positive player, the game will punish you by pairing you with toxic teammates or griefers if your Behavior Score drops slightly, making climbing nearly impossible, OR  after a few wins, the system will almost always match you against significantly stronger opponents or give you weaker teammates to ""balance"" your progress.  - I mean back in the day, ranking up felt rewarding. Now, it feels like the system is deliberately slowing your progress to keep you playing longer, because of smurfs and boosters ruining games or due to role queue exploits!  - If you’ve been playing since 2013 (like me), you’ve probably noticed that Dota 2 doesn’t reward experience. Even if you take a short break, the game seems to ""forget"" your skill level, placing you in worse matches until you ""prove yourself"" again. The low to mid-tier ranks (Crusander to Legend) are where the worst matchmaking occurs—filled with boosted accounts, griefers, and players who don’t care about winning.  - So, to conclude, if you’ve been stuck in the same rank for years despite improving, it’s not (just) your fault—the system is designed this way. Dota 2’s matchmaking doesn’t prioritize fair games it prioritizes engagement, keeping you grinding endlessly. Unless Valve makes drastic changes, the cycle of frustration will continue, making the game feel more like a chore than a rewarding experience. If you’re tired of the grind, the best solution might be to step away—because Dota 2 clearly doesn’t respect your time 👿","buruk"

"76561198088667274","DOTA is one of the best online multiplayer strategy games, which has so much depth to its mechanics in contrast to similar games. An average rank game takes 20 to 45+ minutes. It's okay to lose a couple of games due to skill differences, crucial mistakes, misplays, or even someone griefing (proly having a bad day), DC/abandoning the game. We learn and re-queue next to have a better experience than the last and try our best to win and finally, hope our proper grinding is rewarded. In my opinion, this is the basic idea behind any multiplayer game that improves longevity and quality of life.    Unfortunately, this is not the case with SEA DOTA (7.5k hours of experience it could be similar in other regions), especially in solo rank, 90%( I AM EXAGGERATING CZ UM TILTED FROM THE RECENT 50 GAMES) of the ranked games are either griefing or have someone (sometimes 1 or 2) who is not skilled enough for a certain rank. Within that 90%, you have to play near perfect with minimum mistakes to barely get a win. BY ALL MEANS, I'm an average skilled player who loves Dota (played since 2006 (Dota 1 & 2)). From what I understand, the game is made so that a single person cannot win the entire game by himself ( unlike FPS, where you can skill diff and 1v5). And to talk about that 10%, particularly when playing a party, no matter win or lose, it's AWESOME! BODACIOUS! DOPE!, LIT!, FLY!, BUSSIN!, FIRE!, whatever the GENZ term.    So, in summary, you'll lose more than you win especially when you solo, which will reduce your rank, and you'll end up playing with lower ranks and get accustomed to it and lose more until you say, F##K RANK! No new player will grind cz of the learning curve , proly quit and play LOL or something.    FYI : I'm not talking about the smurfing phase where you cruise through the lower ranks.I'm talking about the ranks where winning requires some degree of teamwork.    TIP : If you must solo queue, GO play EU/AUS or any other server (Atleast those mfs will TRY to communicate)  ","buruk"

You're told if you learn game or new, go play vs bots which aren't going to help you understand a real game since they are simple scripted bots with a few schemes they repeat and your first unranked casual game you're getting destroyed and reported on top .  You go to unranked expecting just that a game where you can relax, learn and practice with other humans, without ruining other ppl ranked score. Instead you get matched up with very high skilled players that likely come from ranked and get reported every single time if you do a wrong move, leading to you having to wait hours on end for another game or get stuck with bots again. You can get  reported just because, the system is automated, if someone reports you because he feels like, you get temp banned regardless if you played good or bad. You go to unranked expecting to pick what you'd like and play something you feel fun, get reported for not following the latest pro meta builds and strategy, bam wait hours for another low priority quewed game. This is a horrible system that shouldn't be available in unranked, except for those cases where you break code of conduit/language insults and such, not for bad/off-meta gameplay. ","buruk"

"76561198018664975","Having played heros of the storm, smite, and to an extent other MOBAs, Dota has the worst new player experience by far thanks to smurfing, stunlock being a core mechanic for pretty much every single build and being killed from offscreen at max health.  I thought stunlocking was obnoxious in smite, I now see I was drastically wrong. Offscreen killings are more common than on screen once you've hit mid-later mid game. I don't want to learn this game having experienced this for four matches straight out of the new player queue (which still had smurfs in it)  I can understand why someone would enjoy this game if they put the time in.

After taking a break and returning, I noticed an unusual pattern: initially, my allies would be significantly stronger than the enemies, making the game feel too easy. However, once I got invested, the matchmaking system seemed to change drastically. I began encountering matches filled with unskilled or toxic teammates, while the opposing team felt disproportionately powerful.  This cycle of alternating between favorable and frustrating matchups feels manipulative and disheartening. I suspect the game’s analytics and matchmaking algorithms are designed to create this pattern, which ultimately affects the enjoyment and fairness of the experience.  Unfortunately, this has impacted my mental well-being and overall experience with the game, and I’ve decided to uninstall it.","buruk"

I expected Dota 2 to be hard, deep, maybe even rewarding in time. Instead, I found a game that actively hates new players.  [h2] Hero Design – Welcome to the Stun-Lock Hell[/h2] Dota 2 doesn’t teach you. It punishes you. • Enemies strike from fog with absurd range. • You're stunned before you see them. • You're deleted before you can blink. • There’s no counterplay, no outplay, no escape.  This isn't a learning curve – it’s a spike through your skull.  [h2] Thrown Into the Fire, Alone[/h2] I requested a coach. No one came. There’s no tutorial that actually helps. No guidance. No mentoring. You're tossed into matches with veterans who will tear you apart, and if you ask for help? Expect pings, flames, or silence.  Dota 2 doesn’t care if you’re learning. It just wants you to suffer or quit.  [h2] The Item System – Designed to Confuse, Not Enhance[/h2] • Active items with no visual clarity • Courier juggling like it’s StarCraft • Recipes that make zero sense • Mandatory outside research just to function  I spent more time alt-tabbing to Wikis than actually playing the game. At some point I asked myself: Is this even fun anymore?  [h2] Chaos Disguised as Depth[/h2] Early game? Slow and punishing. Mid game? Fog ganks and surprise deaths. Late game? Blink in, die instantly, stare at death screen.  I didn’t get better. I got numb and I couldn’t learn from my mistakes because I didn’t even understand what killed me.  It’s not ""deep gameplay."" It’s opaque and abusive game design.  [h2] Community – Gatekeeping on Steroids[/h2] • Ask a question? Get mocked. • Die once? ""Report noob."" • Try to play safe? ""Why u no help?""  This isn't a community. It's a fortress of elitism, and if you’re not already inside, you're just cannon fodder.","buruk"

So even among 1 of the 2 games I won it was still heavily one-sided except it was my side being the unreasonably good side.  Usually when you lose a few games in a role the system will re-rate your skill and match you with easier enemies. Well, not in this game, you can have supper easy wins and losses in a role for as long as a day. I don't enjoy much after winning un-challenging games in a role for that long and certainly don't enjoy losing for that long.  DOTA2 is too broken now.","buruk"

"76561198018347508","I came back to Dota after years and I can't believe what you've done to it. I search for ranked matches in West EU. Literally in every game more than half of the players are from countries other than West EU. Everywhere is full of Russians or Ukrainians. They shout into the voice chat in their own language. They flood the chat text with meaningless characters that no one understands. There's nothing you can do about it. As soon as you politely ask these monkeys for English, that they play in Western Europe, you get even more Russian and Ukrainian as an answer. This is not fun, friends. It really is not. The only option is to mute everyone, but then I can go play any singleplayer and I'll have the same experience. I can't play on more Western servers because of the ping.  I absolutely don't understand why I can't ban heroes in ranked games. The game itself bans heroes completely randomly. What's the point of that?  There is no system in the game to give up a game you've already lost. For example, in a game where everyone is yelling at each other in Ukrainian and Russian. In a game where the pick fails and in the 10th minute the score is 0:20 and it is clear to everyone that it is a loss. In such games you make the players suffer another 20-50 minutes. For leaving earlier and saving nerves and mental health you penalize. Because you don't want the players to have fun. You want them to suffer until the last second. This is not fun, friends. It really is not.  There are many similar games like your Dota on the market. Just get inspired by others. Take the best from them. What you are missing. And for God's sake implement it. You have been working on the game for 12 years and it really doesn't look like that.  In its current state, Dota is almost unplayable. It has nothing to do with fun.","buruk"

"76561198331076107","I really love this game, been playing it religiously since 2013. However, I am very disappointed with how no one is reviewing reports and banning cases in this game. I recently convinced one of my friends to try and play DOTA 2. Since he had a new account, we could only play normal matches together. I main Invoker so as broken as he is, I would normally get lots of kills and have a real presence in the map. However, due to playing Invoker how he is supposed to be played, I was reported as a smurf and ultimately got banned. I appreciate the effort that DOTA is giving to prevent smurfs and hackers from destroying the game, but I am just disappointed with how I was wrongfully banned. I tried sending an appeal, offered to give evidence that this is my only and main account, but I was only given a generic reply. I am writing this to warn people. There is a big power currently given to reports. Play well enough or piss enough number of people and you will be saying goodbye to your account. Nevertheless, the game is fun and addicting. I kind of thankful that I am unable to play so I can stop wasting time on this game LOL.   Note: the lobbies that I get matched into usually have 1-3 players in the enemy team that is either as good as me or better.  Additionally, I do not send harmful stuffs through chat at all, worse that I can say is ask ""where is your bkb?"" to my carry. Lastly, I spammed invoker around 5 years ago, my skills on him is definitely on a higher level compared to how I play other heroes.","buruk"

"76561198302999773","I’ve played Dota 2 for over 2000 hours, enough to say I understand both its brilliance and its failures. The core gameplay is still one of the most complex and rewarding in the MOBA genre, but everything surrounding it feels neglected.    Valve’s lack of consistent updates and communication has left the game stagnant. Balance changes are inconsistent, hero releases are rare, and events feel repetitive or uninspired. For a game that once defined competitive gaming, Dota 2 now feels like it’s running on autopilot.    The community remains as toxic as ever, and new players are thrown into a system that doesn’t teach, protect, or motivate them. The report system barely works, smurfing is rampant, and matchmaking often feels unfair.    At its core, Dota 2 is still a masterpiece, but it’s one that’s being slowly abandoned by the people meant to care for it.  I used to play it out of habit, but now even that habit is fading.","buruk"

But so is the atomic bomb,  and it can kill millions, so in the wrong hands of greedy corporations who want to keep people addicted this game is the equivalent of hard drugs, even worse. Would you recommend a drug? Nope Run away!   The matchmaking is created against you. This game is made to be highly addictive, not to have fun, not to win, you will get a rank and get stuck there until you die or create another account. Only 10% of games are fun. Or if you play unranked, you still have a invisible rank so you will still be sabotaged by the game so it keeps you at 50% loses at least if not under 50%.  You will: Play bad = win Play awesome = lose This EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING and is because they want to keep players losing about the same amount of games they win. This keeps the game addictive BUT not fun. You're constantly grinding and going crazy over trying to have a good game and 1 in 10 times you have just to go crazy again for 9 games.  Is a never ending loop, unless you break out!   Played for a long time, i have thousands of hours in game, I had another account and deleted it. Then came back and played some more. Still same problem. They want you to have 50-50 wins/loses no matter what, that's one of the main focuses. This destroys most of the chances to have fun, and game is always a chore. Just because of how the system is made.  Also played 2 different ranks, so when you get the rank first time you'll be stuck there in 99% of cases.  Got 2 different ranks, how can I be 900mmr and 2-3k mmr ? either one or the other Is because the moment you get your rank, you will remain there because of the algorithm. They refuse to put fair matchmaking because this would make the game fun and people might not get as addicted as now, now is very hard to get rank up so it's addicting but not fun!  They made a business out of it not a game. If they would fix the matchmaking then the game would be awesome. They refuse so is sheet...   I have thousands of times when they put me with idiots when i had more than 50% wins. I'm 100% confident they really don't want to change this. So who created this matchmaking they can play the game themselves. Might play once in a while but no point, is a chore to play it when it works against you.  Just imagine that they have all metrics in game, every single thing, so they know who is more likely to win down to 90% or more. So they will make the matchmaking exactly how they want.

"76561198008125718","The game is becoming more ""flat"" and there are fewer playstyles than 10 years ago. Heroes have slowly been redesigned to play more and more similar to each other, requiring the same level of active involvement in combat situations. For example, 10 years ago heroes like Lich or KotL could have a good impact on combat with a certain level of apm and good reflexes. Today, they require much more apm and attention to have the same level of combat effectiveness and contribution to the team. I used to sit back in teamfights and spam buffs, and not worry about positioning and handling the risky situation. There are no longer heroes that allow me to do that, except maybe Warlock. The subsection of ""sit back and think""-players no longer has a place in DotA2. Only the hyperactive combat-oriented playstyle can win games now, so consider if this is your thing.","buruk"

"76561198355138547","Hello, my name is Miguel, I… I would like to expose my pain, my anguish, my despair, and above all, my years of loneliness that were falsely hidden by this curse they call a game, and that only got worse after I learned how to play Invoker. I… I deeply regret ever starting this.  The year was 2017, I was a young boy wandering and browsing the internet, I needed something to get addicted to and unfortunately, I chose this game instead of pornography or methamphetamine. You, reader, might think I’m exaggerating or using extreme situations to expose my unhappiness. But truly, honestly, maybe it would be better to be in prison right now, paying for the crime of drug use and dealing, serving my 15-year sentence and in the end… in the end, seeing the sunlight and not feeling pain, guilt, sadness, and maybe, maybe, even after all of it, a desire to feel that pain again — that pain more addictive than cocaine. Gabe Newell produced not a game, but a pact you sign, and that pact is Dota 2.  Not because it’s a bad game, not just because of that, but because it consumes you like a demon. It feeds on your pain, your sadness, your anger, and it only grows stronger. Believe me, I’m a rational guy and I’m sure there’s no explanation other than supernatural for what happens when you play this game. It’s the equivalent of shoving a pineapple into your anus and, after bleeding intensely and stabilizing, ripping it out, pouring hot oil, and then pouring alcohol on top of it all. And yet, despite everything, you still feel the urge to repeat the experience.  So yes, it was a pact. I spend my time with this game while it drains my life energy, and in return, I receive trauma, I receive emptiness. I look at the world and see how much time I’ve lost. I could have taken up gardening, learned sign language, become a bodybuilder, or even an astronaut!!! But instead, I was consumed and rotted little by little, until I finally broke free from the roots of evil, looked back at my past, and felt despair for not being able to rescue my younger self — hopeful, innocent…  If you’re reading this, no, don’t play Dota 2. Don’t start something you cannot finish. There’s a reason why most players have over 1,000 hours and still feel regret — and you only discover it when you’re already suffering.","buruk"

Big patches just like minor changes in map, item nerfes, new neutrals and thats all, overpowered supports, super weak core heroes, that cant solo kill in early stages, cause of more affordable saving items, lower overall dps and stun duration, more health points, more jungle camps, gold from stacks, free exp from shrines of wisdom, free wards, shards from tormentor, artifacts with enchantments and tp scrolls on death. Supports double or even tripled their net worth from the times when dota have highest online and biggest prize pool of the international, over the time game moving towards casual gameplay, over-depended on stable nervous system of your teammates, bunch of mechanics and heroes were simplified for the sake of new players, but they totally lost respect of a loyal olds.","buruk"

"76561198078744228","The game itself can be very fun. If you've got 5 friends who want to put a lot of time and energy into learning a complex and, frankly, rewarding game, I actually do recommend it. The problem is that it is a multiplayer game with a lot of complexity and a lot of different ideas on how to play, and no clear answers on how to do it right. Everyone has their own ideas, and pretty much everyone is adamant that their idea is correct. If you think the best path to winning is to group up and deathball down mid, but someone else wants to split push and play for late, then there is going to be a disagreement. Gamers, especially those who are playing an older, competetive game, are famous for their level-headedness and well spoken discussion. Except that they aren't. Nobody talks unless it is to hate each other, you will see slurs everywhere, and nobody will accept that jumping into the opposing team alone was the wrong move, so long as they made it.  There are friendly players. There are good players. There are games where both teams walk away happy.  You will not play in those games. Maybe at the start you'll have some fun ones in between getting stomped, but as you play more and end up alongside people who have forgotten that its a game and not a representation of their self-worth, the good games will become few and far between as you spend most of your time trying to not tilt your teammates. That last bit will destroy any fun you've had in the game, as every interaction, from picking a character to what item you grab, becomes a chance to light the powderkeg. Even muting people doesn't fully stop the hate.   TLDR: I love the game. I think it is one of the most fun and complex games I have ever had the pleasure of putting time into. But I have been playing it for over a decade, taken multiple breaks because of the aforementioned issues, and can only wish I could go back to not knowing anything about the game. Don't confuse your rank for your own value/self-worth, don't listen to the people who do, and be ready to mute/report, and you may have a good time with one of the best games ever made. But you'll likely just end up getting yelled at by people who have little else going on in their lives.","buruk"
"76561198091492750","This game isn’t just a disappointment — it’s a masterclass in how to turn a great game into a hollow and utterly joyless time sink. What you’ll encounter isn’t a polished but a decrepit platform weighed down by technical failures and blatant disregard for players’ time.  Performance and Menus: From the very moment you launch the game, you’re punished with sluggish menus that are overloaded with pointless clutter.  The menu UI is giving the illusion that the game is still actively developed, but in reality, there is essentially zero technical support and almost no meaningful improvements being made. The servers themselves are a disaster - frequent desynchronizations often result in players being falsely accused of abandoning matches, a problem that has persisted for years without remedy.  Server capacity is insufficient, and there is obviously no interest in fixing the backbone of the game.  Matchmaking – The Absolute Low Point: If there’s a single reason to avoid Dota 2 altogether, it’s the matchmaking system.  It is just rigged, unbalanced, and  unfair. The game regularly throws smurfs and new players together.  The ranking system itself is designed around an artificial 50% win rate, with wins and losses being the sole determinants of MMR.  This means you’re not rewarded for general performance, teamwork, or improvements.  Balanced, competitive matches are essentially mythical — you’ll be lucky to find one challenging, fun game out of twenty - don't go down that hole just to chase this experience. The end result is a game that feels less like entertainment and more like a psychological trap.  You’re lured into chasing the rare “worthy” match, but those moments are so vanishingly scarce that they only highlight how broken the rest of the experience is.  Dota 2 is dead.  What remains is a soulless husk dressed up with meaningless cosmetics and superficial updates.  It wastes your time, it disrespects your effort, and it offers nothing in return but frustration.  There are far better ways to spend your time than on a heartless, decaying game like this.","buruk"

Meanwhile, my support engages at level 1 when the enemy got level 2 first, blames me when she dies, abandons the lane three minutes in, and then spends the whole game flaming me for all of the free space to farm the enemy carry got. If that game didn't embody everything wrong with DOTA, I don't know what does.  Everything I used to like about this game isn't here anymore. Mechanical skill barely matters anymore in the face of how many disables practically everyone has and how many of them ignore debuff immunity, the community is so toxic that unless you play absolutely perfectly everything is your fault, and the matchmaking is so bad that you can get complete newbies on your team while the other guys probably have an Invoker who knows all the combos.

"76561198007610291","Dota is still the same game it became many years ago: retard accommodation concept to make profit.  If you play well and too much beyond casual (ie. sunday only players) the game will offset high numerical players with low-numerical ones to 'balance teams.'     The problem arises when it doesn't care for who on what role. When you your p1-2 is a fraud and they're compensated with better p3-5, you will never finish games - as certain roles are more significant than others for winning the game.     This observable through several things:  1. metrics of all players during laning (@10:00min mark) - signaling of skill/ before any interference of other players  2. When you receive 'inverse pie-chart' from ranked roles performances: when you played one role and scored better in all other roles: the game will now believe you offset numerically inferior players and puts you such teams*.  3. the blunt share of disconnecters will be on your team. This is because they are literally afk and thus have lower stats than everyone else, even if the enemy team potentially 5 slots for disconnecters (assuming you never dc yourself).   4. the 'dota 2 rejects' (whom are avoided for being low-metric players throught dotaplus) will always be on your team. Including account buyers and boosted players.  5. You will always be on teams that have support players mid, support offlaner and notoriously double p5, and very soft carries/ midlaners on safelane - usually against fully-fledged teams.    There is no escaping it, unless you take a long break and re-qualify for casual/ welcome back experience.  The entirety of dota 2 matchmaking is fake: dota tracks your likeliness to commit to the game in every single way: and will only drizzle good matches every now and then followed by completely moronic experiences (Valve would like to accommodate everyone including account buyers).  - the length of your game session on each day.  - your willingness to play after a stomp or loss/ how many such games it can give you before you call quit.  - your silence when you have completely mouth-breathing account buyers on your team/ your acceptance of hosting enjoyable experiences for fraudsters (which is why having peak behaviour-score is an actual worse experience than being slightly below).  - If you are on retarded teams, you will naturally end up scoring numerically (even more) relatively better -> which will put on further retarded teams: like a death-spiral. this when you should take a break.    Yes, you can get so much skill that you can literally can carry/ win games with 1-3 account buyers on your team, but it will never be a pleasant experience. This is why most games are extremely stompy/ one-sided these days. Someone has to play with the bad players, and it'll be players who play much.      *this is why should semi-afk when you start losing, sell items and zone-out to lose to quickly, as it neatly lowers your stats. This indeed very toxic and ruins potentially turn-around matches, but you just have to join in on it. If you tryhard, you will just perform even more relatively better than players who do that, and now you'll be offset further on your next matches.      The game is not very refined on how it tracks stats, it just does for the sake of matchmaking.    ","buruk"

"76561198843180031","Is Dota a good game? Potentially yes, it seems fun, well crafted... but there are glaring issues. You have created a system where there is an elitist group of players in every match that will simply beat less experienced players, and putting BRAND new players into those lobbies. Most other games of this genre and generally for every game, will not in fact put BRAND new players against players with 4k+ matches played? There is a clear disadvantage there, even if you play all the tutorial and try AI games. Language and terms are not matched, knowledge of items and the game not there.   Why in the world is this game so beloved? Because the past generation continues to play and upkeeps it, but it is awful. The community is unhelpful and toxic, not in the sense of slurs or insults but rather that they are so unwilling to help and simply flame new players and then make fun of their mistakes instead of doing ANYTHING useful. Whilst not outwardly toxic, this is one of the least fun, most dislikeable communities I've ever seen. I hated every second playing it and I will never do so again and to ANYONE out there starting out, I'd recommend you do the same.   Don't even think about downloading this game unless you spawn in with 1,000 hours played somehow, or sit and watch 300 videos on youtube as guides before playing.

The actual game mechanics are defined by a very short time to kill and a lot of crowd control (stun, fear, silence, etc.). This offers depth and opportunities for teamplay, even if I personally think time to kill is too short. However, this means that it is even more important to communicate with people who just do not want to. Ultimately, Dota 2 is ruined by a complete disconnect between the game mechanics and the community it  spawned.

"76561198042292732","I've played dota on and off for almost 20 years. In my opinion it is the greatest game of all time. Over the years there has been few things in my life that itch like dota. Waking up and just knowing i needed to play a pudge game or storm. The frontier patch was the bell heralding the end of my dota journey. I want to say thanks for everyone who worked on dota and brought it to the world.   I used to believe dota was a skillset. something I could build and use throughout my life. The energy to get better. The time invested reading patch notes and experimenting with mechanics. Learning each and every crevice of the map so i could juke or make a play wherever i was. As I get older, Dota gets faster. what used to be a real time strategy game seems to be moving more to a league of legends type of game. Having a great mind for dota has never been less valuable. As a low immortal I was around 400 wins averaging 25 mmr per win from the top end of immortal. If I could maintain a 60% winrate it would take me 2000 games to reach 15k mmr. in the time it would take to play those games the game will change drastically likely multiple times. New cracked op heroes will dominate the meta for months at a time. The game will get faster,   and my 20 years experience will become irrelevant, or worse detrimental.   Dota wasnt a game that needed *fixing*. I understand that popularity is the only metric most game designers care about now a days. But it was a deeply flawed concept that you could simply mirror league of legends design philosophy having rotations of heroes being OP instead of aiming for balance. Dota shouldnt be an APM check either. it should be strategy and execution.    If Dota was slower (Lower the amount of things you can accomplish in 60 seconds). If I didnt have to worry about the next frontier patch. If Dota was being designed for balance. If New heroes were designed as less is more. If the game design philosophy of league and fortnite had never taken root in Dota. I would still be playing. And I could recommend this game to other players.  Dota with its current team of no doubt all star industry game designers perhaps might bring Dota into a new golden age of popularity. But I will sadly not being playing.

"76561198060729415","The game is awesome, but since the beginning of the year, it keeps crashing because a certain file is missing. Then comes this whole cycle of trying to download something that doesn’t actually download (unless you disable your antivirus), and after that, verifying the game files. This always happens after you've selected a hero or the match has started, and then you lose MMR and get punished with low priority games — all because of something that’s not your fault.  It completely kills my motivation to play with problems like this. I even bought a new computer because I read the issue might be with the RAM, SSD, or something else — but the problem is still here.  Why does the game even launch if it’s missing a file that will crash it as soon as it starts???  ","buruk"

"76561199109036512","There are three major issues with this game: - Is extremely unintuitive - Relies too much on stun mechanics - Punishes newer players... hard     For some reason, the tutorial system is very unhelpful. The first 8 tutorials seem fine and dandy, but after that, every tutorial either crashes your game, is extremely difficult, or is just not functional. When you enter a game, you are given a selection of a very generous amount of heroes, each of which have 2 or 3 ability changes which serve to further change the match up to some degree, which is fine unless you have only around 30 seconds to select from them in a match. You could somewhat circumvent this by testing each hero in a single player environment, but this shows not a whole lot about your match ups against other heroes or multiple heroes or which heroes to pick to have best effect with.    When you get into a fight, you'll notice a pattern, start by killing the creeps, then charge at the enemy heroes with a three second long stun, then shred their health pool before they have a chance of doing anything about it. If you are landed in this situation, you have three options, run... and die, fight back... and die, or stun them back... and still die except you dealt some damage. This system relies too much on stuns, its even worse if your teammate happens to surround you in trees... for some reason. that also works to just kill you, and even worse, you might have lived if your teammate had helped to get the enemies off of you.    When you join a match.. everyone is relatively evenly matched, until someone gets one kill, levels up and unlocks a 3 second stun, which snowballs into the entire enemy team being twice the level of even your highest teammate, so having one teammate that's newer to the system just leads to having every enemy be twice as strong. So basically securing first blood usually means your team just... wins... for free... and there isn't much the enemy team can do about it, except keep feeding you levels.","buruk"

"76561198066400677","I would like to say that though the game is probably one of the most unique games of all time, I cannot recommend it in its current state. I think that the gameplay, phases of the game and all the heros uniqueness is what makes it one of the best games of all time.  I cant reccomend the current map state. The whole point of DOTA is to make it so that its a multiplayer online battle arena which in turn means you fight for victory via strategy, positioning and timing.   As the map has become 20% - 30% bigger, it adds more jungle camps within the game which is a bad thing. The jungle mechanic is supposed to be a downtime during the very early stages of the game and not during the mid or late game. Because you add jungle camps on the outskirts of the map, it creates where both teams just AFK farm for 30 minutes and try to scale even though if you are in an advantageous position. You cannot rally to create a smoke gank, you cannot ward because you would be alone and even if you did get a ward off, the chances you kill someone is really low because you have your team still farming the outskirts of the map.  Because of these changes, the skill level has drastically became lower for players especially their awareness of the game state. You have people barely even ganking the lanes and for people that even want to gank, you have players ignore your pings about you coming to gank and they just afk farm while you die all because of these jungle camps. It makes them less aware about the game state and just makes them go into a monochrome state where ""i am not ready to fight unless im 6 slotted"" and even then, they are sometimes useless with a 6 slot state.  Check my wraith king teammate, he had no presence whatsoever because he was always getting kited, nice item choice retard.  You have added point of interests such as the lotus area, the exp gathering area and the tormentor however they are never even contested most of the time (besides the lotus area in the early game I guess but that dies really fast). They see it as a detriment to go to that far just because they would rather go to a jungle camp and contest something that can give them even a bigger boost to fight. The tormentor has never ever been touched in japan server (and yes i know japan has all the russian rejects that dont play the game properly but that doesnt change the state it should be in) and i think that it should be changed so that it goes to where the sanctuary is.  The most fun patch was probably the updates when they had the shrines but I think with their positioning of the shrines, it made it a power spot to have turn potential. I think if you add shrines back into the game it should be next to tier two towers. This way it punishes the mid if they just use it for farm and not harassing their lane and you also enforce a retreat timing for people that have ganked but can return to the field of battle fast but not too fast to the point where it was too OP.  I think if you enjoy constant fights, you should not play this game right now. They have a lot to work on when it comes to the game especially with all of the russian reject cykas coming to japan server and ruining my game experience. Keep in mind i still get good Russian players that are constantly aggressive and I commend them, but i would say 70% are russian rejects that never played DOTA before source 2.  Drow players think they are good, anti mage players think they are good. All you did was AFK farm and you won the game. It shouldnt be this way. Fuck you drow players especially, you dont play the game properly at all you fucking retards.

"76561198867267251","The game changed so much after the  ""The New Journey"" [7.00] update. I tried to adapt but just couldn’t. One of my biggest gripes is how the developers made matches longer. Games used to last 25–40 minutes, but after this update, I was stuck in 60+ minute sessions. That’s just too much time, man.  There was also a clear shift toward forced teamplay instead of personal skill. Heroes became way tankier and harder to kill, and the introduction of new support items like aeon disk and rain drops just broke the game, in my opinion. The ban phase in ranked All Pick feels stupid, and the glyph refresh after the first set of towers falls into the same category. Dota just doesn’t feel like the old days anymore, when individual plays had a huge impact.  Moreover, the dark fantasy style got replaced by cringy emotes and cosmetics. Some Arcana items aren’t even available on the market anymore because they’re locked behind Battle Passes.  At this point, Dota 2 just isn’t the game I fell in love with. ","buruk"

"76561198136634919","Oh boy, where do I even begin? They ruined Techies. Absolutely gutted him. Once the most chaotic, creative, and downright unhinged hero in Dota 2, Techies used to be the embodiment of psychological warfare. A hero that didn’t just play the game—he reshaped it. You didn’t just lane against Techies you lived in fear of him. Every step outside your base was a gamble. Every jungle path, every rune check, every high ground push—a potential death sentence. And that was the beauty of it.    Techies wasn’t just about kills. He was about map control, area denial, vision, tempo disruption, and yes, burst damage that could delete a carry before they even realized they were in danger. He was a puzzle the enemy team had to solve every game. Do we buy detection? Do we send the support to face-check? Do we delay our push because we know there’s a minefield waiting? He forced you to think differently.    And now? Now he’s just... a stun bot with a grenade and a sad little zap. They turned a hero that used to be a walking trap card into a glorified ranged initiator. Sure, he’s more “teamfight viable” now, but at what cost? They stripped away the soul of the hero. The mad genius who could single-handedly stall a game for 20 minutes, who could turn a lost match into a win with one perfectly timed suicide and a mine stack in the trees.    People used to hate Techies, and that was the point. He was supposed to be annoying. He was supposed to be different. He was the anti-meta, the chaos factor, the wildcard. And now he’s just... another cog in the machine. Another hero with a cookie-cutter build and a predictable playstyle.    I miss the old Techies. The one who made you paranoid. The one who made you laugh maniacally when a triple kill popped up from a minefield you planted 10 minutes ago. The one who made you feel something—rage, joy, fear, awe. Now? He just makes me feel... disappointed.","buruk"

"76561198822333430","I’d like to sincerely request a review regarding my recent placement into Low Priority (LP). The incident happened during a Turbo match, which I was playing casually with my friends. Unfortunately, due to a sudden power outage caused by rain, I got disconnected and was unable to reconnect in time.  What’s particularly disheartening is receiving LP for a Turbo game—a mode that’s meant for quick, casual fun. I wasn’t trying to ruin anyone’s experience, and you can check that I was partying with friends. Getting LP for this completely takes away the fun, especially since it’s almost impossible to find LP matches, and no one wants to queue with you to clear them.  I understand if this system applies to Ranked or Competitive matches, but Turbo should be more forgiving. This experience honestly made me uninstall the game, despite the many hours I’ve spent enjoying Dota 2 over the years.  Please consider reviewing this case and the broader LP rules for Turbo matches. Casual players shouldn't be punished so severely for unintentional disconnects in non-competitive modes.","buruk"

"76561198002156890","TL:DR The actual gameplay is top-tier MOBA and valve made a solid attempt to make playing/learning the genre reasonable, but the community is rancid and multiplayer is entirely the point.  Its always odd to say you recommend the game *itself* but can't recommend playing it with other human beings, especially when the game is specifically multiplayer focused. Its very well put together: I enjoy the visuals, VA, character designs and mechanics (even if I find the shop's added complexity a little much for an already high skill ceiling game). But its a MOBA, you have to play it with others, and a good chunk of the time if you don't have a regular gaming group of friends to call upon, it is abuse and toxicity of the highest order.  It'd be one thing to spend your limited time on this earth playing a game with some of the most unpleasant people I've had the misfortune of meeting, it's entirely another to be locked in with them for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour. Its possible to be held hostage by team-mates who refuse to play communally or admit defeat when it's obvious. Its possible that your own poor play ruins the game for everyone else on your team early on, with little means to claw back the difference. It is an unforgiving game to learn and more punishment than play in all regards.  I don't know if its just part and parcel of the genre forever after now -like how if you play any given FPS multiplayer long enough you'll have a 12 year old claim copulation with your mother- but LoL and DOTA2 have killed my interest in the genre forever. If I see MOBA as a tag on a new game, I steer very clear.   If you have remarkably thick skin, an organised consistent group of friends to play with/against or just adore the genre despite its community failings, go right ahead. DOTA 2 is a good game that's terrible to play.","buruk"

"76561198276891606","This game is stupid difficult to learn. The tutorial is bad and is broken.  It is a game for who knows best, and acquiring this knowledge is hard.  I even saw a video saying that I am the one who makes how to learn it, hard. Can you believe that?  Pity League of Legends doesn´t run on Linux. It still has lots of things to learn, but mostly how to think tactically and strategically, not how to switch equipment in slots, or buy an equipment that changes the stats of other equipment when you buy them.","buruk"

"76561197980821645","used to be good. I preferred the game in the state it was in around 10 years ago or more. I feel like the game is catering to the high end players, as that is their source of income. The communities are toxic, games you are losing get dragged out so long because the winners want to pre-long the feeling of winning, meaning 50% of games are just painful as a game could be lost, but will still drag on for another 25 minutes. Years in and no surrender mechanic to deal with this, so you get locked into suffering. Its hard to push and win with your own team because everyone else wants to drag the game out, so if you try to end the game on your own, your own team flames at you. Its just toxic. I played this game for such a long time, but I only ever play with bots with one of my friends. But the bots dont get updated at all. Modders have tried to fix the problem, but their core behaviour is so lack luster that there is only so much they can do. Make's me sad. I used to play this for hours and hours in PVP games... but these days... I wouldnt recommend to someone new.","buruk"

You get smurfs, braindead people or players who returned after a break and their rank is way too low for their skill level, getting out of legend is impossible unless you give 100%.    Also what annoys me the most is that matches in which one team outdrafts another end up in a loss when it should've been won late-game by that team. All because of the feeding of your brainless teammates and shit teamfights that they organize    Carry meta is also shit at the moment and nothing seems strong.

"76561198041364222","The fact you have to play 100h (!!!) of unranked to even be granted to access ranked is FREAKING stupid. It will result in you getting your a** clapped by some 2000+ matches nolifers. THAT will be your only experience. I've played 4 matches now and I never managed to have a good time, not even a bit. Valve somehow is the WORST at creating unranked and ranked experiences with every game they release. This game sadly is one of the cases where its even worse than I had imagined.  In CS2 you have to get level 3 or smth to play ranked. That takes smth like 2h of casual or deathmatch or whatever. Not enjoyable but not too bothersome. Now imagine the same thing but you are basically forced to play what essentially is the ranked experience, just without a rank. Versus people that have spent THOUSANDS of hours with the game already. Considering you need to gotta play 100h that is roughly 100-140 matches. How does ANYONE at Valve think that playing that amount of matches versus people that will ALWAYS wipe the floor with you is desirable.  There IS a ""beginner mode"" (which i ALWAYS dominated without any issues, and no prior MOBA experience), however that mode does NOT count towards the 100h goal even tho it essentially IS casual (just without the ""you get your a** clapped aspect, as everyone is a newb).  Game isn't even too bad otherwise, but making the first 100ish hours of a game the absolut worst experience imagineable is just stupid.","buruk"
"76561198026489287","Mechanically, DoTA 2 is head and shoulders above any other game in the entire MOBA genre. Nothing else even comes close to the feeling of the game from a mechanics standpoint. You have more freedom and room for player skill expression than any other game in the market, more options for strange niche builds that still manage to work.  Unfortunately, it doesn't matter, because the game is crippled by its own matchmaking system. Matchmaking will attempt, very poorly, to make sure you have a roughly 50/50 win/loss rate. This means that you are effectively punished for having good matches, because they absolutely guarantee that within your next few games, you will find that Valve has gifted Steam accounts to uncontacted tribesmen from the depths of the Amazon, and they will astound you by playing videogames so poorly that it's no wonder they never advanced beyond living in huts.   On top of that, the entire normals pool can have brand new players. That causes two problems. One, new players are not matched with other new players, they're just mixed in at random, and good luck to you Johnny Newbie when you go against a six thousand hour player. Two, there is zero smurf detection, and smurfing is absolutely rampant to the point where it's likely that well over half of any ""new"" accounts are actually just some several-thousand-hour player exploiting matchmaking or farming the account up to sell it.  I wish I could recommend the game. I can't. It's a great game absolutely ruined by matchmaking and there is zero chance it ever gets fixed.","buruk"

"76561198360810336","I used to be a decent human being before I installed Dota 2. Now I’m basically a walking proximity chat. This game turned me from “gg have fun” to “mid or uninstall” in record time. I flame harder than a Terrorblade with meta, and my patience is lower than a CoD lobby when you drop a nuke.  In Dota, every match feels like Search & Destroy but stretched over 50 minutes. One wrong smoke, one missed Black Hole, and suddenly I’m screaming at strangers like I’m back in Modern Warfare 2 voice chat circa 2009. I don’t say “good job” anymore, I just spam “???” like a UAV ping.  The wins? Oh, they hit like a headshot with stopping power—pure dopamine. But the losses? They feel like getting quickscoped off spawn ten times in a row while your offlane Sniper types “report team.” And yet, I queue again, like some broken Prestige grinder chasing MMR instead of gold camos.  Dota didn’t just change my personality—it gave me the full toxic gamer loadout. Tilt, flame, ping spam, and permanent trust issues.  Final thoughts, 10/10. I hate this game. I love this game.
