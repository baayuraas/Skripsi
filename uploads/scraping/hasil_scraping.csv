"76561198058437603","If you've ever wanted to age 40 years in a weekend, cry in three different emotional languages, and question your life choices every 15 minutes, congratulations — Dota 2 is your soulmate and your captor.    The game is ""free to play,"" which is ironic, because you pay with your soul. The tutorial tells you it's a strategy game, but what it fails to mention is that your biggest opponent is your own teammates. Playing Dota is like being in a hostage situation where you're also one of the kidnappers.    The matchmaking system is powered by an advanced AI that matches you with people who have either just installed the game, or just escaped a mental institution. Sometimes both. Balance? Oh, you mean the illusion of hope?    You'll find yourself saying things like:    “Why is Techies in my game again?”    “Why is the support farming mid?”    “Why am I still playing this?”    Each match starts with optimism and ends with depression, kind of like birthdays after you turn 30.    Let’s talk about toxicity. Dota 2 doesn’t have toxic players. No, that would be too simple. It has biohazard waste in voice chat. The kind of people who will ping your death three times, call you slurs in three languages, then proceed to die alone in the forest for 40 minutes.    The worst part? You’ll love it. Because winning in Dota 2 is like finding meaning in your life — rare, euphoric, and followed by a crushing loss that resets you back to reality.    In summary:  Dota 2 is the best worst thing to ever happen to me. It’s like Stockholm Syndrome with patch notes. 10/10 would uninstall and reinstall again out of pure spite.","baik"

"76561199528783285","Отличная игра в которой тебе всё расскажут и даже не только про игру! Ты узнаешь о необычных работах своих родственников, о том насколько много людей любит и обожает твою маму. Также один из плюсов это большой выбор героев с не сложным управлением. Например Invoker очень легкий персонаж с кучей урона подходящий для поднятия рейтинга. Комьюнити очень хорошее, иногда встречаются игроки которые настолько хорошо играют, что ломают все свои вещи и собирают новые так как хотят дать фору врагам. Также разработчики очень усердно работают над обновлениями которые выходят раз в полгода и выпускаются для того чтобы онлайн повысился с 10 человек до 11 ( при этом в игру зашел сам разработчик).

"76561198106503136","I only played this because League of Legends put me in timeout for telling a 13-year-old jungler to uninstall their soul.    Let me set the scene: it was a dark, shameful day. Riot Games had finally pulled the plug on my main account after a small misunderstanding involving ten ping spams, three racial slurs (none mine!), and one elo-defining loss. So what did I do? Reflect? Seek therapy? Touch grass?    No. I rebounded hard—straight into the open, masochistic arms of Dota 2.    And let me tell you: it was like crawling out of a frat house fight pit and stumbling into a sadistic chess tournament being played by Russian AIs with gambling addictions. This isn’t a game. It’s a graduate-level course in suffering, delivered exclusively through slurs, spreadsheets, and a mini-map that actively gaslights you.    You think League is toxic? Dota 2 players don’t flame you—they curse your bloodline. A Peruvian witch doctor once told me to feed my courier to Roshan and then die in real life. I didn’t even know what a courier was yet. Beautiful.    The learning curve? Imagine climbing Mount Everest, but it's vertical, on fire, and halfway up someone throws a techies minefield at your crotch. Every character has 42 active abilities, a secret satanic pact, and a passive-aggressive Reddit community explaining why you're doing it all wrong. There’s no “meta”—there’s only pain, and ten dudes yelling in five languages about “item timings” while your tower disintegrates like your self-esteem.    But oh, the complexity. The strategy. The high you get from landing a five-man black hole or denying a creep like a smug little Victorian landlord. I once got a triple kill with a flaming horseman while being coached mid-game by a Russian with a drinking problem and a heart of gold. It was the most bonding I’ve experienced since my parents’ divorce.    And the graphics? It looks like a Warhammer figurine collection got possessed by Satan and reanimated using Valve’s leftover Half-Life particles. Every match feels like a beautiful fever dream inside a burning cathedral.    Final Thoughts:  Dota 2 is the game you play when you’ve hit rock bottom in League and decided to dig deeper. It doesn’t hold your hand. It rips your hand off, feeds it to a jungle creep, and then blames you for feeding. It’s brutal, exhilarating, and almost certainly responsible for 12% of global blood pressure medication sales.    I came here because I was banned.  I stayed because the voices in my head said ""GLHF.""    10/10. Would flame myself again.","baik"

But once you get hooked, there’s no escape.  The gameplay is deep, the heroes are diverse, and every match feels like a new disaster (or masterpiece). Just remember: if you win, it’s all skill. If you lose? Obviously, your team’s fault.  10/10 – Would feed mid again.","baik"

"76561198056110994","Ah, Dota 2, the game that's less of a hobby and more of an emotional rollercoaster designed to test your patience, sanity, and keyboard durability! It’s truly a masterpiece in the art of inducing rage while somehow keeping you crawling back for more punishment.    First, let’s talk about the gameplay: What a joy it is to spend 45 minutes meticulously building your hero, only to have one teammate feed the enemy like they're running a charity buffet. Don’t even get me started on the absolute thrill of random matchmaking—because why would you want a balanced game when you can be paired with someone who just discovered what a mouse is?    The graphics? Oh, they’re great! The perfect eye candy to distract you from the existential crisis of watching your ancient crumble while your team argues about whose fault it is in chat. And the community! Such a warm, welcoming group of individuals who will kindly explain, in great detail, how you should uninstall the game after every minor mistake.    But the fun doesn’t stop there! No, because even after losing your 10th ranked match in a row and smashing your personal record for “most rage-induced alt+f4s in a day,” you’ll still come back tomorrow, because there’s always that one perfect game where everything clicks… until it doesn’t.    So yes, Dota 2 is an absolute blast. In the same way that walking barefoot on LEGO bricks is a thrilling experience. Fun? Sure, I guess. Insanity-inducing? Absolutely. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who enjoys suffering disguised as entertainment.","baik"

"76561198051539046","I've been playing Dota since its early days as a custom map in Warcraft III long before Dota 2 became the global phenomenon it is today. For me, this isn't just a game it's a huge part of my childhood and personal growth.  From Dota 1 to Dota 2, I've witnessed how the game evolved so called new mechanics, updated heroes, refined graphics, and better matchmaking systems. While some changes felt overwhelming at first, I’ve come to appreciate that evolution is part of what makes Dota such a masterpiece. It constantly challenges you to adapt, learn, and grow.  But Dota is more than just a game of mechanics and skill. It’s taught me so much about critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and even how to manage my emotions during high-pressure, often chaotic moments. Every match is unpredictable and that’s what makes it endlessly rewarding.  My Advice: Don’t play this game if you have low patience, poor communication, or if you prefer solo gameplay.  Dota is not for trolls or for those who take team coordination lightly.  If you're ready to be humbled, challenged, and (eventually) sharpened—welcome aboard.  This game holds many cherished memories, including countless moments with online friends I've made along the way. Some of them are no longer with us, and I want to say: RIP to my fallen teammates—you’ll always be part of my journey.  Cheers to Dota—for being more than just a game. It’s a lifelong lesson in resilience, strategy, and camaraderie. GGWP. GGEZ ","baik"
"76561198307637623","With over 3,800 hours poured into Dota 2, I can confidently say this game is more than just a pastime, it's a way of life. Every match is a new challenge, where strategy, teamwork, and skill are constantly put to the test. No two games are ever the same, and that’s what makes it so addicting. The depth of mechanics, hero variety, and the ever-evolving meta keep things fresh even after thousands of hours.  The feeling of executing the perfect team fight, landing that game-changing Black Hole, or carrying your team to victory after a grueling 60-minute battle is unmatched. But on the flip side, the game will test your patience like nothing else. The highs are incredible, but the lows can be brutal. It's a game that rewards dedication and punishes mistakes, making every win feel truly earned.  The community can be intense, and the learning curve is steep, but once you get past the initial struggle, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Whether you're playing casually or grinding ranked, every match teaches you something new. Even after thousands of hours, I still find myself improving and discovering new ways to outplay opponents.  Dota 2 is not just a game, it's a never-ending battle of wits and reflexes that keeps you coming back for more.

"76561197961034904","[h1]Final Rating: 9/10[/h1]    [h1]Gameplay[/h1]  At its core, Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other, with the ultimate goal of destroying the enemy’s Ancient, a large structure located deep within their base. Players choose from over 120 unique heroes, each with distinct abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. The variety of heroes ensures that no two matches are alike, as team composition and strategy can dramatically alter the flow of the game.    The game is divided into three phases: the early game (laning phase), the mid-game (team fights and map control), and the late game (high-stakes engagements and sieging). Players must balance farming for gold, pushing lanes, securing objectives like towers and Roshan (a powerful neutral boss), and engaging in team fights. The complexity of Dota 2 comes from managing these elements while coordinating with your team, outmaneuvering your opponents, and making game-changing decisions under pressure.    [h1]Heroes and Roles[/h1]  The vast hero pool is one of Dota 2’s greatest strengths. Heroes are generally divided into roles such as carry, support, initiator, and disabler, though many heroes can fit multiple roles depending on how they are played. Each hero has a unique set of abilities, which often interact with one another in surprising ways. This makes team composition and synergy crucial for success.    Carries are heroes who tend to be weak in the early game but become powerful later, carrying the team to victory if they farm well.  Supports protect the carries, control the map with wards, and provide valuable utility through healing, disables, or other buffs.  Initiators start fights with abilities that can catch enemies off guard, often turning the tide of the game.  Mastering a hero is a rewarding experience, but the constant updates and balance patches mean players must continuously adapt their playstyles and strategies.    [h1]Learning Curve and Complexity[/h1]  One of the most defining aspects of Dota 2 is its notoriously steep learning curve. New players can be easily overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information they need to absorb: hero abilities, item builds, map awareness, last-hitting, positioning, and the intricacies of teamwork. The game does offer tutorials and an in-game guide system that helps ease newcomers into the basics, but even these can feel insufficient given the depth of the game.    Experienced players often cite Dota 2 as a game of ""infinite learning."" Even veterans with thousands of hours logged continue to discover new strategies and tricks. The game rewards dedication, and players who are willing to invest the time to learn will find themselves constantly improving.    However, this complexity can also be a barrier to entry. Players who are unwilling to put in the effort to learn the game’s systems may find themselves frustrated, especially since poor individual performance can negatively impact the entire team.    [h1]Community and Esports[/h1]  Dota 2 has one of the most passionate and diverse player bases in the gaming world. Its free-to-play model allows anyone to access the full game without paying for heroes or other gameplay advantages, ensuring a level playing field. However, Dota 2's community can be both a blessing and a curse. While many players are eager to help and share strategies, others can be toxic, especially in lower skill brackets. Negative behavior like flaming and blaming teammates can sometimes overshadow the cooperative nature of the game.    On the esports front, Dota 2 shines brightly. Valve’s annual tournament, The International (TI), has broken records for the largest prize pools in esports history, with crowd-funded prize pools often exceeding $30 million. The tournament is a spectacle, showcasing the game at its highest level, with professional players demonstrating mind-blowing levels of skill, teamwork, and strategy. Watching TI or other major Dota 2 events can be an educational experience for aspiring players, as it reveals the depths of the game’s potential.    [h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]  The visual presentation of Dota 2 is polished and artistically refined. The game runs on Valve’s Source 2 engine, which allows for smooth performance and detailed graphics, even on mid-range systems. Each hero is uniquely designed, making them instantly recognizable both visually and through their animations. Spells and abilities are animated clearly, which is essential in a game where visual clarity can mean the difference between winning or losing a fight.    The sound design in Dota 2 complements the visual experience, with distinct audio cues for each hero's abilities and ultimate moves. This adds to the game’s tactical depth, as skilled players can recognize what is happening just by listening to the sounds of a battle. The voice acting is another strong point, with each hero having a distinctive personality, often taunting enemies or celebrating victories with memorable lines.    [h1]Monetization[/h1]  Despite being free-to-play, Dota 2 offers a wide array of cosmetic items, from skins and custom hero models to unique ward appearances, couriers, and announcer packs. Valve has implemented a Battle Pass system that ties into The International, offering players seasonal rewards and cosmetics while contributing to the prize pool for the tournament.    Importantly, all purchasable items in Dota 2 are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay. This ensures that the game remains fair for everyone, with no ""pay-to-win"" elements. Players who do not want to spend money can still access all heroes, maps, and game modes without restriction.    [h1]Replayability and Time Commitment[/h1]  Dota 2 offers virtually infinite replayability. With over 120 heroes and countless combinations of strategies, no two games feel exactly the same. Each match is dynamic, with shifting objectives, unpredictable team fights, and constantly evolving meta-games. Players who enjoy a game where learning never truly stops will find themselves coming back again and again.    However, the time commitment required to play Dota 2 is significant. Matches typically last between 30 to 50 minutes, and a particularly competitive game can easily go over an hour. This, combined with the steep learning curve, means Dota 2 demands a lot of its players. For those willing to invest the time, the game’s depth is rewarding, but more casual players might find it difficult to stay engaged over long periods.    [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  Dota 2 is a masterpiece of strategic depth, skill-based gameplay, and complex team dynamics. Its blend of hero variety, constant updates, and a thriving esports scene makes it one of the most enduring games in the MOBA genre. However, the game’s steep learning curve, time-consuming matches, and sometimes toxic community can be off-putting to new players. Despite these challenges, Dota 2 remains a highly rewarding experience for those who are willing to put in the effort to master its intricacies.    [b]Pros:[/b]  • Vast hero pool and strategic depth.  • Free-to-play with no gameplay advantages tied to purchases.  • Regular updates and new content.  • Thriving esports scene with huge prize pools.  • High replayability with endless tactical possibilities.    [b]Cons:[/b]  • Steep learning curve can be intimidating for new players.  • Matches can last over an hour, requiring significant time commitment.  • Occasional toxicity within the community.  • Complex mechanics can be overwhelming at first.    [h1]Final Rating: 9/10[/h1]  Dota 2 is a game of immense complexity and depth that rewards dedication. For players seeking a challenging and highly competitive MOBA experience, it is second to none. However, its steep learning curve and lengthy matches may not be for everyone. Nevertheless, Dota 2 stands as one of the most compelling and strategically rich games available today.","baik"

"76561198242530534","(Played from 2015–2020)  Dota 2 is an amazing game, no doubt about it. The complexity, variety, and depth make it a masterpiece in its genre. No two matches are ever the same, which keeps things fresh and exciting every time you play. It’s especially fun with friends, where teamwork and coordination can lead to some of the most satisfying victories you’ll ever experience in gaming.  But beware—this game is highly addictive. Once you're in, it’s hard to let go. The thrill of improving, the rush of a good play, and the challenge of outsmarting your opponents create a loop that’s incredibly difficult to break. For me, Dota 2 became more than a game—it was a daily ritual for five years.  However, it’s not all perfect. Playing with strangers can sometimes ruin the experience, especially when someone decides to throw the game or has a bad attitude. And the addictive nature of Dota 2 can make it all-consuming if you’re not careful.  That said, I somehow managed to quit in 2020. Breaking free wasn’t easy, but I’m glad I did. Still, I’ll always respect what this game offers—its unmatched strategy, intense gameplay, and unforgettable moments. If you’re thinking of diving into Dota 2, just be prepared for the time and energy it demands.  TLDR: A brilliant, highly addictive game that’s best enjoyed with friends. Just know what you’re signing up for before you queue up.","baik"

"76561199118217933","A super fun game to play with friends, but the experience on the Southeast Asian and Chinese servers can be quite rough—especially in China. In matchmaking, there are often anonymous players with numbered accounts who throw games, steal roles, and insult even pro-level players with toxic comments.  For those who just want to play normally, without feeding or typing insults, it’s frustrating to lose points over malicious reports or unreliable servers. Sometimes, you can’t even ping teammates’ skills, and dropping below 10,000 MMR for these reasons is just infuriating.  With the low player base on the Chinese server, some players create multiple smurf accounts just to dominate lanes and ‘smash low ranks,’ which is hard to avoid.  But on a brighter note, I welcome anyone who wants to team up and rank up together for some wholesome, supportive gaming. I’m a relaxed and friendly support main, no drama or stress—let’s help each other out! QAQ.","baik"

Toxicity, voice chat toxicity from others, pinging, blaming, etc. But on the bright side sometimes you can meet some people who become your close friends and it's fun playing together.

"76561197970870292","Well.... I've played for 1k hours and I still suck. But somehow this game is still incredibly fun, no matter the frustration that occurs when you think your team is well built and you end up getting stomped. I don't know how a game with only one map is still fun after 1k hours, but this one certainly is.     The matchmaking is so incredibly atrocious. It tells you a game is a good match when one person on the other team has more MVPs than your entire team has games played. That, or you get matched against a group of noobs and even if you try to play nice, you still end up stomping them. Its the games in between those two that keep me coming back. The ones where it is back and forth and neither side knows who is going to win until the ancient falls. The ones where you think you're about to lose, and somehow you and your team are able to win a good team fight and dive right down the middle and destroy their ancient while none of them have buybacks.     Its silly fun. There are a lot of D-bags though. Use the mute function. But, if youre new, make sure you can see and hear what your team is saying until you confirm they are jerks.

"76561199199064904","Dota 2 – 8.5/10  Complexity and Depth (10/10)    Strength: Dota 2 is, without a doubt, a masterclass in complexity. The sheer depth of its mechanics, hero diversity, and item synergies puts it leagues ahead of most games in the MOBA genre. It’s a strategy game at its core, akin to chess—every move matters, and the intricacies of the game make it an experience that can be studied and mastered over years.  Critique: But that complexity is a double-edged sword. For new players, it’s an overwhelming nightmare. The learning curve is brutal, and Valve offers little in the way of meaningful guidance. The onboarding process is practically non-existent, leaving beginners to be eaten alive by veterans who seem to enjoy crushing newbies. It’s a game that feels intentionally impenetrable to all but the most dedicated.  Toxic Community (4/10)    Strength: Let’s be honest—there’s little positive to say about Dota 2’s community. If anything, surviving the constant stream of verbal abuse from your own teammates is part of the challenge.  Critique: And I mean constant. Almost every game feels like you’ve walked into a battle not just against the opposing team, but against your own. The toxicity here is on another level. Every player has seemingly met your mom and gone on a date with her (and they won’t stop telling you about it). Trash talk, insults, and outright harassment are standard fare. The report system is a joke, with trolls and toxic players rarely facing meaningful consequences. If you have thin skin, Dota 2 will chew you up and spit you out. In truth, the community is one of the game’s biggest flaws, and the reason many players quit before they ever get a chance to enjoy the depth.  Gameplay and Strategy (9/10)    Strength: When it comes to gameplay and strategy, Dota 2 is second to none. Every match is a battle of wits, reflexes, and teamwork. The balance between micro-decisions (like last-hitting, item timings) and macro-strategy (map control, hero synergy, objectives) creates an experience that is endlessly engaging for those who love deep, strategic gameplay. For me, it’s like chess, but with spells and carnage—an endlessly complex battle of minds.  Critique: However, Dota 2’s complexity can also be its Achilles' heel. Matches are long, often 45 minutes to an hour, and they demand intense focus throughout. One mistake, one player feeding, or even one player deciding to rage quit can turn a game into an unwinnable slog. For casual players, this level of intensity and investment can be exhausting. It’s not a game you can just jump into for a quick session it demands time, patience, and a thick skin.  Balance and Meta (8.5/10)    Strength: Valve does a commendable job of keeping the game balanced, especially given the sheer number of heroes and items. The meta is constantly evolving, which keeps things fresh for experienced players.  Critique: That said, the game is notoriously imbalanced at times. Certain heroes become flavor-of-the-month picks, dominating the meta until they’re nerfed into oblivion. Balance patches often swing too far in one direction, leaving entire heroes or strategies feeling either broken or useless. The constant meta shifts, while exciting for hardcore players, can also feel disruptive for those who prefer consistency. Some matches devolve into ""who picked the most overpowered hero"" rather than true strategic depth.  Replayability (10/10)    Strength: Dota 2 is one of the most replayable games ever made. With over 120 heroes, hundreds of items, and infinite combinations of strategies, no two matches are the same. It’s the type of game you can easily sink 1,500+ hours into and still feel like a beginner at times. Every match presents a new challenge, and there’s always something to improve on.  Critique: But that replayability comes at a cost—a cost that’s not just time but your mental sanity. Dota 2 is addictive, but it’s also punishing. There’s a reason the phrase ""Dota ruins lives"" exists. Once you’re hooked, it’s hard to walk away, even when you know you should.  Learning Curve (6/10)    Strength: For veteran players, the game’s depth is part of the appeal.  Critique: For newcomers, though, the learning curve is borderline abusive. Dota 2 does nothing to welcome new players into its fold. There’s no meaningful tutorial, no hand-holding, and no easing you into the complexities of its systems. You’re thrown into the deep end and expected to swim. Most new players drown—and that’s not just a critique of the game, but a failure of the developer to realize that its gatekeeping community is driving away potential new fans.  Final Verdict: 8.5/10  Dota 2 is a game that will either consume you or break you—sometimes both. It’s incredibly deep, with a level of strategic complexity that few games can match, but it’s also incredibly hostile, both in terms of community and accessibility. If you can survive the toxic players, the endless learning curve, and the punishing defeats, you’ll find a game that offers limitless challenge and reward.    But be warned—Dota 2 is not for the faint of heart. It’s a game that requires thick skin, endless patience, and a willingness to suffer for your victories. And yet, for those of us who endure it, it’s like chess with fireballs—impossibly frustrating, yet deeply satisfying.","baik"
"76561198431602813","I started playing a week ago, and it's been a lot of fun so far. A bit of a learning curve is required, but that's fun since there are so many heroes to learn until you find a few that you can bounce to.     I recommend trying a few bot matches to get the hang of things with heroes and play styles before jumping into online, at least that's what I did and now I feel more confident playing against others.    Overall, I would recommend Dota 2. It's fun and easy to get into, and enjoyable if you got 30-40 minutes to burn.","baik"

And once you're hooked, it becomes a cycle of frustration, salt, and the occasional glorious win that keeps you coming back.

All heroes are available from the start, no paywalls, and every match feels intense because one mistake can completely change the game. Matches are longer, but you’re on edge the whole time.    The buyback mechanic, being able to teleport anywhere, and the crazy amount of item combinations really make the game deep. I still struggle with learning all the items, but that’s part of what keeps it fun you can play the same hero in so many different ways. What I personally love the most is the courier. It brings you your items and you control it yourself, which adds another layer of mechanics to the game.

"76561198148444934","Dota 2 used to be one of my go-to games for its strategic depth, team coordination, and the excitement of high-stakes matches. However, over the past few years, I've noticed that the game has taken a turn for the worse due to recent updates. The constant changes to heroes, items, and game mechanics have made the game feel less balanced and more frustrating. It seems like every patch introduces new overpowered heroes or items, which disrupts the meta and makes the game less enjoyable for those who don't have the time to constantly adapt. Moreover, the introduction of new mechanics has made the game overly complicated and less accessible to both new and returning players. The focus on monetization, such as battle passes and cosmetic items, feels like it has taken priority over improving the core gameplay experience. While the game still has its merits and remains good in many aspects, these changes have made it less fun and more of a chore for me. Consequently, I no longer play Dota 2 as much as I used to.

It’s the bond you form with your teammates, even if you’ve never met them before, united by a shared goal and that deep, unspoken understanding of the game’s intensity. Dota 2 teaches you about resilience, about the highs and lows of victory and defeat, and how every mistake is a lesson.

"76561198083553340","Introduction Dota 2 is an iconic multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve Corporation. Released in 2013, the game is the successor to the Warcraft III: Defense of the Ancients (DotA) modification and has since grown into one of the main esports titans. Its complex gameplay, endless strategic depth, and active community make it a unique phenomenon in the gaming industry.  Gameplay: Skill vs. Tactics Dota 2 is based on battles between two teams of five players, the goal of which is to destroy the enemy ""fortress"" (Ancient), while protecting their own. Each player controls a unique hero with a set of abilities that develop during the match. Here, not only reaction and mechanical skill are important, but also team coordination, choice of tactics, and map control.  - Heroes and roles: More than 120 heroes with different roles (tanks, support, carry, mages) allow you to endlessly experiment with combinations. - Items and Progression: Gold and XP earned in combat unlock powerful items and upgrades, adding layers of strategy.  - Match Dynamics: Games last between 20 and 60 minutes, with the outcome often decided in decisive team skirmishes.  Graphics and Sound: Functionality and Atmosphere Dota 2 doesn’t strive for photorealism, but its vibrant art style and detailed maps have stood the test of time. Regular visual updates and ability effects are pleasing to the eye. The sound design perfectly complements the gameplay: unique hero lines, ability cues, and epic music at critical moments enhance immersion.  Features and Community - Free-to-Play: All in-game benefits are available without paying. Purchases only concern cosmetics (skins, animations), which maintains balance. - Esports: The International tournament attracts millions of viewers every year, and prize pools reach tens of millions of dollars. - Tutorials and Community: The game offers tutorials and modes for beginners, but the steep learning curve means there is a high barrier to entry. The community is active, but sometimes toxic, which is something to consider.  Pros: + Incredible strategic depth and replayability. + Regular updates and support from Valve. + Vibrant esports scene and spectacular tournaments. + Fair monetization without pay-to-win.  Cons: - Complexity for beginners: requires time to master the mechanics and meta. - Potentially toxic players in public matches. - Match lengths can be tiring.  Conclusion Dota 2 is a game for those willing to dedicate time to learning its mechanics and nuances. It rewards skill, teamwork, and strategic thinking, while remaining one of the most complex and intense MOBAs on the market. If you're looking for a challenge, want to dive into the eSports culture, or just enjoy fast-paced tactical battles, Dota 2 is worth a try. However, those who prefer casual gameplay or are afraid of high difficulty may want to consider other titles in the genre.","baik"
"76561197967288976","If you’ve ever thought, “I’d like to systematically erode my will to live while being yelled at in Russian,” Dota 2 is the game for you. With over 7000 hours invested — or, more accurately, irretrievably discarded — I can confidently say that Dota 2 doesn’t just suck your soul. It files a change-of-ownership form with the devil, adds your essence to a punch card, and hands you a battle pass as consolation.    The thrill of logging in has long since devolved into a Pavlovian dread-response. Each match is less a game and more a hostage negotiation where your captors are twelve-year-olds with no filter, teammates who pick Techies unironically, and a matchmaking system that could be replaced by a blindfolded chimp throwing darts at a dartboard labeled “MMR.”    The community, if we can even call it that, is a vibrant mosaic of dysfunction. A glorious melting pot of racism, slurs, death threats, and unsolicited life advice from people who unironically use anime profile pictures and think “support diff” is a valid argument.    Friendships? Gone. Relationships? Dismantled. Playing Dota 2 with someone you love is like renovating a house with them: one of you will end up in therapy, and the other will just leave. If you want to test the strength of any bond, forget trust falls. Queue up for ranked.    And yet, despite everything — the emotional scarring, the social carnage, the existential despair — the game calls you back. Not with excitement, but with grim obligation. Like paying taxes. Or visiting a relative in the hospital who doesn’t remember your name but still manages to call you a disappointment.    Dota 2 is not a game. It’s a lifestyle choice. A bad one. Like ketamine at a children’s party.    Play it if you must. But know this: Dota 2 doesn't just ruin your day. It ruins your decade.","baik"

Depth of gameplay? So deep I still don’t know what half the items do, and I’ve been playing for three years. There are so many heroes that sometimes I feel like I’m one of them – usually the one who dies first. Dota 2 teaches patience (mostly with random teammates), cooperation (with people yelling in seven different languages), and rewards you… well, when you actually win, you feel like the smartest being in the universe. This isn’t just a game – it’s a lifestyle. Kind of like a toxic relationship, but I just can’t quit.","baik"

Ultimately, although a competitive game is usually a lot more fun when you are winning, you can't play a game that you are only going to have fun when you are winning otherwise if you end up playing the game for 10000 hours like me, you will only enjoy 5000 hours of gameplay with a 50% winrate. If you are eager to play this game, the most overpowered ability everyone can use in game is the mute button, pre-mute the entire lobby upon loading in. If your team start losing, 9/10 either you will be flamed (even if you are playing well) or the whole team cohesion breaks down.   If the reason you want to play this game is to enjoy the teamplay and social aspect of playing a 5 vs 5 competitive game, I suggest you play something else. If you want to challenge yourself as a solo player, focus on your game entirely and develop your skill... then this game is extremely rewarding as you get better. I love this game and always will, but I am in love with the game itself and certainly not the people who play it. These people have nothing else going on in their lives and are essentially gambling with their serotonin, if they winning they are happy and if they losing they are children.  To put it into perspective, I come home from a long day of work and maybe play 1 or 2 games, I play something fun and creative, like a hero that is usually an offlane hero as a carry, if we win I'm a legend, if we lose people start crying and start pointing the finger. I have fun regardless because of the mute button, but if you don't have thick skin, this game will negatively affect your happiness.  Good luck and have fun, praying that the community treats you well (although I doubt it).","baik"

"76561198875160567","Dota 2 is a masterpiece of strategy, skill, and straight-up emotional damage. One match you feel like a genius, pulling off insane plays and carrying your team to victory. The next match, you wonder why you even touched this game in the first place.  The good side:  It’s 100% free.  The depth is unmatched—every hero, every draft, every team fight feels unique.  When things go right, it’s one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming.  The bad side:  Games can last an hour and still be thrown in the last 2 minutes.  You will meet toxic teammates and questionable decision-making on a spiritual level.  Sleep, free time, and sanity may no longer belong to you.  But here’s the truth: no matter how tilted you get, you’ll uninstall it… only to reinstall it again a week later. Dota 2 isn’t just a game—it’s a lifestyle of suffering and glory.  10/10 would rage, uninstall, and reinstall again.","baik"

High-skilled players on new accounts who just ruin the match for everyone else. It feels completely unfair and honestly makes you want to uninstall sometimes.

"76561198869796797","  This game is filled with both admirable and unpleasant moments. One of the most disheartening issues that frequently occurs in many matches is encountering boosters—skilled and intelligent yet dishonorable players who, for a minimal fee, compromise the integrity of the game and make matches unfair.

"76561199212794929","Dota 2 is the granddaddy of making you question every life choice, but in the best way possible. It’s not just a MOBA it’s Valve’s never-ending science experiment where five strangers try to cooperate (and usually flame each other) for an hour, all because someone picked Techies.  At first glance, you’re like, “Okay, just smash their Ancient, got it.” But then you realize there’s a billion tiny things to juggle: weird hero powers, bonkers item builds, and a meta that changes faster than Twitter drama. Over 120 heroes, by the way, so good luck learning them all. Every match is like opening a new puzzle box, except sometimes it explodes in your face.  The gameplay? Absolute chaos, but with a rhythm. You’re farming, you’re warding, you’re yelling at your carry for stealing your last hit. One second you’re a farming bot, next you’re in a teamfight where one missed spell means instant regret. Sometimes you pull off a sick play and feel like a genius other times you misclick and want to uninstall. That’s Dota, baby.  And don’t get me started on the learning curve, it’s more like falling off a cliff. You’ll lose. A lot. Even the pros keep getting blindsided by new patches. Valve loves to shake things up: new items, hero reworks, weird balance changes. Blink and you’re outdated.  But when you finally get it, like really nail a combo or outsmart the enemy? That rush is unreal. Every game tells a different story personalities flare, egos clash, someone always blames the support. It’s beautiful chaos.  Visually, Dota 2’s got style. Clean graphics, flashy spells, and you can actually tell what’s happening (most of the time). The sound design? Legendary. That announcer pack calling your rampage, pure dopamine.  Let’s talk esports for a sec. The International isn’t just another tourney, it’s basically the Super Bowl of nerds, raining ridiculous amounts of cash and hype. The Dota community is wild, sometimes toxic, but always passionate. They’ll argue about the meta for days, but that’s half the fun.  At the end of the day, Dota 2 isn’t for quitters. It wants your brain, your reflexes, your soul. But if you’re up for the challenge, there’s nothing quite like it. It’s the ultimate game of wits, teamwork, and occasionally, pure chaos. Welcome to the madness.","baik"

"76561198865895697","The Game is simple and yet it require you to at least have 100 hrs to understand the basics of the game. The wide range of heroes and items makes this game a little complicated for the new comers which is fine if you are ready to invest your time in it at least 100 hrs for basics and 500 hrs to understand heroes and their abilities, items.  The game have 5 positions and 3 lanes on each side with each position having their part to play in the game. Its a proper team game you cannot side on your teammate's shoulder for a free ride. As far as i understand the game the key 5 positions are 1st the carry as the name describe you gotta do it if your are pos 1. 2nd The mid either you make the game or break the game simple. 3rd Offlane you are the face of the frontline act like it. 4th Soft support you gotta make the plays with you team. 5th hard support you gotta protect your teammate even if it means sacrificing your life. Knowledge is power in this game knowing what to make at what time to make is very essential and crucial to the game.  The game community is not kind and sweet its a competitive game either you win or you lose no in between. The game offers you wide range of communication to use and communicate with your team please use it. The learning is very fun but once you know YOU KNOW. If you are veteran player guide the new ones and if you are new it will take time there is a lot of things to understand in this game and many things change after a big patch.

"76561198181088699","Look, Dota is a Moba and I think people have a perception of Mobas (especially more well known ones) being toxic gaming environment for people who have nothing better to do with their lives. This perception is fair but I think Dota is great for a  few reasons that if you mesh with, great! Give the game a try. If you don't think any of these appeal to you, completely fair.  1. You live for the high of a game. A lot of the gameplay in Dota is nothing crazy. But every now and then you do a crazy play or sequence of events that as soon as it's over you're like ""What the fuck?! I can't believe I just did that!"" There can be different variations but while these moments are rare they feel incredible and can keep pushing you forward. If you're someone who wants a more consistent dopamine rush maybe not the best for you.  2. You love to see yourself improving. Not so much of a dopamine rush, but Dota has a stupid high skill ceiling. You can almost always see yourself slowly improving over time from last hitting, map awareness, itemization, drafting, and anything in between. It's a very satisfying but not exciting feeling that I enjoy and I think plays a big role into why I still play this game, and also why I don't consider these dopamine rushes. I will also take this chance to say as someone who's played both, I do think Dota is more difficult than Lol.  3. You have people play with. Yeah it's crazy huh? Turns out that if you're playing a multiplayer game, it's almost always more fun to have people to play the game with you. Hell, just having friends who you can talk about the game with makes it substantially more fun and engaging. It doesn't need to be friends starting the game at the same time as you but it's nice if you have a friend or group that wants to give it a try.   Overall, Dota is a frustrating but also rewarding game with a steep learning process. If you ever want to take the time to learn the ins and outs of a game then I highly recommend giving it a try.","baik"

"76561198027758678","I wandered into enemy territory like Dora the Explorer and got ganked into the afterlife. Would get ganked again :)  🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics 🎮 Dota 2 is mechanically deep. It's clear that once you understand its systems - items, roles, combos, counters - you can really shine. Even in just two matches, I could feel how high the skill ceiling is and how rewarding it might be with time. Abilities feel impactful, character movement is clean, and the variety of playable heroes is impressive.  That said, the gameplay felt overwhelming at first. Between map objectives, the item shop, and general combat flow, it throws a lot at you quickly. If you don’t already know what you’re doing or take time to study up, it’s easy to feel behind.  👀 Visuals & Aesthetic 👀 This part genuinely surprised me. Dota 2 looks great. It's clean, colourful, and less cluttered than other MOBAS I’ve tried. The UI is still packed with info, but the combat visuals are sharp. Animations are smooth, and the game feels polished across the board.  🧠 Learning Curve 🧠 I skipped the tutorial at first, and that was a mistake. My first match was rough - I didn’t understand the shop, my abilities, or what I was supposed to do. Once I went back and played the tutorial, I understood a lot more, but even then, it was clear that I’d need to put in several hours to play competently. This isn’t a quick, jump-in-and-go type of game. It’s meant for players who enjoy studying mechanics and improving over time.  🤝 Team Communication 🤝 This was a weak spot for me. I tried typing, and even calling things out in chat - but got almost no response. If you’re someone who values communication and team coordination, solo queue might feel a bit lifeless. Playing without friends made the whole experience feel more disconnected than I expected.  💰 Monetization 💰 No complaints here. There’s a huge selection of cosmetics, but they didn’t feel overpriced or aggressive. It feels like a game built for long-term investment, and the monetization reflects that in a fair way.  ✅ Final Verdict ✅ Dota 2 is a great game. It’s polished, smartly designed, and clearly built for people who want to invest real time into learning it. But for me, it’s just not the kind of game I enjoy long-term.  I respect it, I get the appeal, and I actually had fun with the chaos of learning. But I don’t see myself coming back to it. You'll probably love this if you’re into high-skill, team-focused strategy games and have the patience to learn. If not, you’ll bounce off it just like I did.","baik"

"76561198285279875","Dota 2, ohhh Dota 2, you, the parent of the MOBA genre.   I started playing it knowing that it would be a challenge in terms of mechanics, but perhaps that is part of its charm – having the determination and patience to learn its mechanics and subtleties. In the past, I have tried other MOBA games, but I can confidently say that Dota 2 feels different. It is much more dynamic, much more chaotic, and this chaos gives it a high level of enjoyment and satisfaction.  On the community side, I have been fortunate to meet quality players who have demonstrated good conduct, with whom I have managed to build long-lasting collaborations in the game. Being able to develop strategies and coordinate with these players has provided me with an even deeper gaming experience.  The way Dota 2 delivers action and gaming experiences proves that the team behind it knows how to do their job well. While it doesn’t deliver content very frequently, each update adds value and refinement to the game. As the saying goes, “great things come in small packages.”  In conclusion, Dota 2 is, in my opinion, a true work of art. It is a diamond in the current gaming landscape, and I am convinced it will remain just as brilliant over time. If you haven’t tried it yet, or maybe you’ve only played it for a short period, I encourage you to give it another chance. This masterpiece deserves every minute spent in its complex and fascinating universe.","baik"

"76561198087359542","Dota 2: The Pinnacle of Competitive Game Design.  There are video games, and then there is Dota 2—a colossal masterpiece, a test of intellect, reflexes, teamwork, and strategic depth that remains unmatched in the gaming world. Born from the custom Warcraft III mod “Defense of the Ancients,” and nurtured into a full-fledged phenomenon by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 stands not merely as a game, but as a living, breathing arena of infinite possibility.    A Symphony of Complexity.  At its core, Dota 2 is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). Simple in premise, but what lies beneath is an ocean of interwoven mechanics, constantly shifting metas, and limitless skill expression.    Over 120 unique heroes, each with four or more abilities, synergies, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no templates here. Every hero is a universe.    Hundreds of items, each changing the dynamics of a fight, farm, or strategy. Itemization is not routine it's adaptive, reactionary, and highly situational.    No two matches are the same. The fog of war, real-time decision-making, unpredictable enemy movement, and the emergent behaviors of ten distinct human players mean that Dota 2 evolves every second, every game.    Where most games reward mechanical prowess or reflexes, Dota 2 demands it alongside macro knowledge, drafting intelligence, map awareness, timing, risk assessment, and an almost spiritual level of synergy with your teammates. It is chess with a pulse, and every move can echo into triumph or defeat.    No Pay to Win, All Skill.  One of Dota 2’s most defining traits is its purely skill-based model. Every hero is free. Every mechanic is transparent. There are no advantages sold—only cosmetics. Every victory is earned, every defeat is a lesson, and every player shares the exact same tools. The difference is in how you use them.    There is no hiding in Dota. Skill, knowledge, communication, and experience are laid bare in every move. This is why the game attracts the sharpest minds and most passionate players.    The Tactical Depth of a War Room.  Unlike many modern games that simplify gameplay loops to maximize appeal, Dota 2 embraces complexity—and the player base reveres it. Consider:    Drafting phase: Even before the game begins, the psychological warfare has started. Bans, picks, counters, combos—this is a metagame in itself.    Laning stage: Not just farming. It's about lane control, pulling, stacking, zoning, power spike timing, and reading the opponent's intent.    Mid to late game: It's a mental gauntlet. You think like a general. You calculate Roshan timings, smoke ganks, tower trade-offs, vision wars, cooldowns, buybacks, and split-push potential—all in real time.    Every decision can spiral the game in a different direction. Dota 2 does not reward random aggression it rewards calculated violence.    Community, History, and Esports Glory.  Dota 2 birthed The International, the most prestigious esports tournament in history—its prize pool funded directly by the community. TI finals are viewed by millions, not just for gameplay, but for the stories:    Underdog comebacks, Once-in-a-lifetime plays, Retirement runs and Cinderella moments    Legends are made on this battlefield. The community’s passion has kept the game evolving for over a decade, making it not just a game, but a shared mythos.    A Game That Grows With You.  Dota 2 has no ceiling. You can play for 10,000 hours and still learn something new. You become wiser, more disciplined, and more aware—not just in game, but in life. It teaches:    Patience (you will lose games for dumb mistakes)    Communication (you need to align five strangers into one unit)    Resilience (you will experience comebacks and heartbreaks)    Leadership and humility (sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow)    It sharpens your mind like few other digital experiences can. For those who crave mastery, Dota 2 is not just a game, it is a lifelong dojo.    Constantly Evolving, Yet Always Familiar.  Valve’s updates keep Dota alive, balancing nostalgia with innovation. From massive gameplay overhauls to subtle item tweaks, the game never stagnates. Patch notes are read like holy scripture, studied, debated, and then adapted to. It’s a cycle of rebirth every few months.    And yet, no matter how much it changes, Dota always feels like home. The radiant base. The dire cliffs. The pit where Roshan lives. These are etched in memory. It is your battlefield. Your proving ground.    Final Verdict: The Greatest Game Ever Made.  Dota 2 is art, science, sport, and strategy fused into one. It doesn’t coddle you. It demands your best, and it gives you the tools to find it. In a world increasingly defined by fast content and short attention spans, Dota 2 rewards depth, thought, and perseverance.    It may not be for everyone—but for those who seek the apex of digital competition, who dream of orchestrating five-man wombo combos and outplaying a whole team with one clutch move, Dota 2 is the undisputed throne.    It’s not just a game.    It’s the arena of gods.    Clan Doto Forever.    ","baik"

"76561198253291986","Dota 2 is a game I love… but it wears me down with endless updates and constant rebalancing.  I've spent many years with this game. I’ve seen ages pass, heroes rise and fall, items appear and vanish. Dota 2 is more than just a game — it’s a battlefield of minds and wills, where every match tells a story. You don’t just press buttons here — you live a full life in one evening.  But with the years comes a kind of fatigue. Not from the game itself — from the fact that it is never allowed to settle.  Just as you get into it, adapt, master a hero, and begin to truly enjoy the experience — everything changes again. Not just small tweaks — entire systems are torn apart and rebuilt. The heroes you knew like a friends becomes a strangers. The item that defined your strategy is gone. The meta you were finally beginning to understand — swept away.  In other games, updates feel like a celebration. Here, they often feel like grief. Each patch in Dota is like a dagger to the heart. They remove beloved skills, rewrite familiar mechanics, endlessly reshuffle the balance. It feels less like creative improvement and more like compulsive tinkering.  If updates were less frequent, they would be anticipated, even welcomed — not met with a tired sigh of ""Oh no, another patch… again? Seriously?"" And please, stop endlessly tuning the balance. Focus on things that don’t rewrite the foundations every time.  I understand — the game needs to live. But there’s a difference between life and restlessness.  This is a competitive game. This is E-sports. In sports, the rules don’t change every few weeks. Where is the stability? Where is the respect for the player’s time and learning? It often feels like the changes exist just for the sake of having changes — not because they’re needed.  To the developers, if you happen to read this — please, slow down! Don’t ruin what’s good in pursuit of something ""better."" Not every structure needs rebuilding. Not every system needs redesign.  Yes, we welcome new heroes. Yes, we love new items and seasonal content. But not every week or month. Let the game breathe. Let us live in it, not constantly study it.  P.S. Special thanks to whoever created the Turbo mode. For those of us with jobs, families, and a life outside of Dota — it’s a blessing. Turbo is like a short, joyful story before bed. Fast, fun, and without burnout.  I still love this game. I have, and maybe always will — unless one day it’s changed so much it stops being the game I once loved. But like any weary warrior, I ask not for more battles — I ask for a moment of rest between them… and for the rules to stop changing. Dota is a classic. It’s chess. Stop rewriting how the pieces move.","baik"
"76561198445331943","Classic game of strategy so complex that every update changes the game and the way it's played because of the buff/nerf-ment of heroes. Recently the game has introduced many new heroes and introduced many changes in items of heroes as well. I used to play it very often long time ago but recently started playing it again, back in the days the skins for the heroes were rare and expensive but now it seems that things are getting pretty cheap and you can get hero skins for a fraction of original prices.","baik"
"76561198261061047","Dota 2 is a legendary multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve. It features a 5v5 team format where each side aims to destroy the enemy base.  One of Dota 2’s strongest points is its depth and variety. The game has over 100 heroes, each with unique abilities and playstyles. This makes every match feel different and requires players to think strategically, work as a team, and react quickly.  The graphics and sound design are top-notch. The map is detailed, and the ability animations are visually pleasing. Regular updates from the developers bring balance changes, new heroes and items, and in-game events. Dota 2 also has a thriving esports scene — tournaments like The International attract millions of viewers and offer huge prize pools.  However, it’s worth noting that the game has a steep learning curve and can be unforgiving. New players may find it difficult to get into, and the community can sometimes be toxic. Also, matches tend to last 30–50 minutes on average, requiring focus and patience.  Pros: -Huge variety of heroes and items -Deep strategy and teamwork -Regular updates and support -Well-developed esports scene  Cons: -Steep learning curve for newcomers -Sometimes toxic community -Long match durations","baik"
"76561198030784015","This game has over 2.4 MILLION reviews and is mostly positive.   Seriously, with games like this there's not much else I can add to the vast body of reviews already explaining why the game is good.  Personally I've only written around 14,000 reviews, evaluating each game on it's own merits and the value proposition it offers compared to other games at similar prices.  Most of the reviews I write are negative, but most of the games that I give negative reviews to are widely ignored by gamers anyway, with only a handful of players in most cases.  Almost all the time, I'm just saying what other people think when they breeze on by and browse onto other games.  Gamers ignore bad games for a reason... and they pay attention to great games for good reason, too.  What I'm trying to say, is there's some wisdom in crowds, at least when it comes to games on Steam.  People don't play or even bother buying or downloading bad games.  But when 2.4 million people write a review for a game, it means they care about it.  There's something there.  The more players, the bigger it is.  This is definitely true for DOTA2.   One of the first in the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), DOTA (Defense of the Ancients) was a player-made map for Blizzard's Warcraft 3 RTS.  The map proved so popular that Valve decided to make a standalone sequel (with different mechanics of course) that proved to be one of the greatest competitive game formats known.  Part of the success is the expanded variability of NPC ""creeps"", low level soldiers that fight on your behalf, combined with rich player skill trees, adding completely new dimensions to the old RTS formula.  But I guess you don't need a history lesson.   There's a reason so many people have played this.  Because it's one of the greatest games of all time.","baik"

There is simply too many heroes, items and viable hero builds, that even in hour 700 you can still try something new and refreshing. But the biggest win for Dota 2 is the rare satisfaction in playing against highly skilled opponents, and still outwitting them and winning anyway. That's Dota 2 at its best.    Simultaneously, however, you will learn to hate yourself and everyone else. Your teammates will snap at you and each other more often than not.

"76561198367471798","Few games have shaped the esports landscape as profoundly as Dota 2. Developed by Valve, this free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) stands as a towering giant in competitive gaming—complex, rewarding, and fiercely strategic.  At its core, Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other in a battle to destroy the opposing team’s Ancient, a heavily guarded structure deep within their base. With over a hundred unique heroes, each boasting distinct abilities, playstyles, and roles, no two matches feel the same.  The game balances macromanagement of the battlefield with micromanagement of your hero’s growth—you’ll be farming gold, buying items, coordinating with teammates, ganking enemies, and executing game-changing team fights. It’s a demanding dance of skill, strategy, and split-second decision-making.  Dota 2 is notoriously complex. Its steep learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, but the depth is precisely what has kept the community thriving for years. Every patch introduces balance changes, new items, and sometimes new heroes, ensuring the meta continually evolves.  Mastering one hero, let alone the entire roster, requires time and dedication—but the satisfaction of outplaying an opponent or turning the tide in a crucial moment is unparalleled.  Visually, Dota 2 is colorful and detailed, with each hero uniquely animated and designed to stand out. The maps are richly textured, providing clear tactical information while remaining aesthetically pleasing. Sound design is top-notch, with distinct voice lines, spell effects, and ambient noises contributing to the immersive experience.  With one of the largest esports scenes globally, Dota 2’s The International tournament offers multi-million-dollar prize pools and draws millions of viewers worldwide. The community is passionate, vocal, and dedicated, though the competitive nature can sometimes lead to a steep social environment.  Dota 2 is a monument to strategic depth and player skill—a game that rewards patience, teamwork, and creativity. If you’re willing to invest the time, it offers a rich, endlessly evolving battlefield where every match is a new story.  Complex, competitive, and compelling—Dota 2 remains the pinnacle of MOBA excellence.  Rating: 9/10","baik"

"76561198043610692","Wonderful game! Great gameplay, great graphics, fun for hours and hours, it never gets old.   Message to devs:  You guys are doing a great job at retention, but the game would also greatly benefit from having more people play. For this, it needs to be more accessible to beginners, and casual players.  1- fix smurfing. Currently the main issue holding back the potential of the game in non ranked games (where casual players hang). Reporting is not enough, smurf accounts need to be banned, and IPs creating several smurf accounts need to be prevented to do so.  2- Improve beginners experience. The tutorial is good, but limiting playable heroes at start just creates frustration when new players can't play their favorite hero. Instead, have suggested heroes. Match making amongst players with 0 games or 0 victory is a must have (and of course coupled with the smurf fix above). Bots training is great but it's boring. It's very important to let beginners play with other beginners.  3- Skin quality. This is a much lower priority item, but it could really improve monetization. Many base models and old skins have really poor model/texture/etc. quality. The reward of receiving a random skin after a game is negated if said skin is so poor quality that it's not even worth equiping. Also, one of the stregth of Dota2 against competitors is the visual quality, so making sure all models have a consistent baseline quality, and staying coherent with the universe, is key to preserve and emphasize this strength.  Cheers!","baik"
"76561197985368010","This is not a casual game! Highly competitive.   If you have ever said ""It's just a game "" don't install it. Seriously.    This is not a simple game! If overly complex tactics and strategies are overwhelming. This game isn't for you.  There are a lot of variables, synergies, counters maneuvers, tactics etc to consider. There is a very large learning curve, many players do not reach the plateau of this curve , never mind the peak. The game is un-fun for people below this plateau. Imagine trying to play football without knowing what an offside, a field goal  or a punt is.   There are layers to understanding where a concept clicks and you think you understand, yet you are not seeing the bigger picture.  Football is considerably simpler but an analogy would be:  ""I am run ball, I am reach back, points is good, Don't get tackle. Sometimes I can throw, I'm master tactician""  -Most people     If you have a competitive heart and are prepared practice and fail to get better to achieve better skill expression this is one of the best games for that.    This is the original and best MOBA. I've played most of the big name competitors.  LOL can't match the depth and the strategy. HON being a clone did a good impression.  The game is a well executed strategic staple that will go down as one of the greats.    DOTA does have issues with the developers keeping their favorite heroes at the top of meta and keeping broken stuff in game because of fan noise also there are issues with rank assignment and smurfing in public games now that the game is older and less attention is paid to those kind of problems. These can be complex issues to solve and most games have similar issues.    TLDR  One of the best games ever, not for filthy casuals. Get good or move on.","baik"

"76561199447396541","Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 40 hours   1. general thoughts and how i started: I was 15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that saying ""nothing"" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  2. Did i waste my youth?: So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts ""lets learn music"" or ""lets study"" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of ""improving"" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.  3. time invested into dota2: EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of ""oh man i shouldve learned something with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.."" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.  REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start understanding how to farm -> M . M . R  YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)).  ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do","baik"

"76561198054113777","The best game you should never play. I started playing Dota 2 nine years ago as a way to keep up with college friends on Friday night. After a few years, they moved on to other games while I became more obsessed. Consistently, through big patches and drastic meta changes, it is the best designed, most brilliant MOBA. No matter their personality, a player can find their hero pool for their play style. Aggressive, passive, assassin, tank, support, manage tons of summons, whatever you like you can find a niche. Unfortunately, it takes a hundreds of hours just be competent. Player base can amazing or toxic, just the luck of the draw. Unfortunately, we are years past the glory days of TI. It is no longer the biggest prize pool in E-Sports. Valve squandered the opportunity to turn Dota into a true sport that non-players would watch. I don't know what new blood is coming in to keep game alive. But if you love MOBAs, you will love this one.","baik"
"76561199547506218","In my 1,697 hours of Dota 2, I found something unexpected peace that roars louder than silence, sanity sharpened by chaos, and a strange cure for depression hidden in the clash of heroes. If you ever think about stepping into this world, plan ahead it’s not just a game, it’s a battlefield for your mind. Play with friends, share the victories, laugh through the defeats. But if you walk this path alone, be warned: the game will not forgive you. Sanity is fragile here, and madness lurks just one match away.","baik"
"76561198049113742","I've played a handful of matches and can see why this game and genre has so many devoted fans. A friend described Dota 2 as a ""sustained thrill"". You can play a 45-minute game and be totally engaged and fascinated for the entire duration. And you feel that same thrill every time you play.","baik"
"76561198030661393","For most people, DOTA is just another game, with a very steep learning curve.  But its core playerbase knows they'll be playing it for life.  DOTA is a timeless classic, the chess and poker of our digital age.","baik"

"76561198320667773","Fun and strategic. Good for you if you enjoy continuous learning, or if you enjoy the excitement of seeing your hard-earned skills being rewarded.   Furthermore, good for people who likes the social aspect of gaming (although you need to add some friends to stack with first which can take a while, trying to communicate with people in your solo games will be hard).  Playing in a team of five that vibe together, creates strong bonds.","baik"
"76561198309049558","Dota 2 is one of the most complex and rewarding competitive games ever created. With over a hundred unique heroes, endless strategies, and constantly evolving gameplay, every match feels fresh and different. The learning curve is steep, and it can be intimidating for new players, but the payoff is incredible once you start to understand the mechanics and teamwork required.  The graphics and animations are polished, and the regular updates keep the game balanced and exciting. Valve’s support through seasonal events and the yearly International tournament also adds to the game’s global community feel.  What truly makes Dota 2 stand out is the depth of strategy and the satisfaction of pulling off a well-coordinated team play. At the same time, it can be frustrating—games are long, mistakes are punishing, and toxic players do exist. But if you enjoy competitive, high-skill games with limitless replayability, Dota 2 delivers an experience few games can match.  ⭐ Rating: 4.5/5","baik"
"76561198100227357","If you're looking for an experience with more sophistication than League of Legends this game is exactly that.    The primary focus of the game is less direct despite both having the same win condition (destruction of enemy objectives). Instead of it being a test of purely mechanical skill, this game also tests game knowledge, team coordination, and awareness. I would place this game closer to RTS in nature than most MOBA contemporaries, which makes sense considering that real-time strategy is the etymology of the MOBA genre as a whole.    In short I play this and not League anymore because this is more entertaining. Not noobie friendly, requires dedication to learning.

It’s a realm where the thrill of the game flows like a river, sometimes calm and other times rushing at breakneck speed, but always keeping you on the edge of your seat.  Each match is a canvas, and the heroes are your paintbrushes. You’re not just playing a game you’re creating art in motion, one moment of brilliance at a time. Victory doesn’t come easy, but it’s the sweet reward of the effort, like the final note of a song that leaves you breathless.  The community is a powerful force—sometimes a storm, sometimes a breeze, but always adding layers to the experience. Every interaction, every new teammate or opponent, is like a spark that ignites something new and unexpected in the game. You never know what you’re going to face, and that unpredictability is part of the magic that keeps you coming back.  In Dota 2, you’re not just playing—you’re living the game.

"76561198233002780","Dota 2 Review: The Ultimate Love-Hate Relationship in Gaming  Where Chess Meets Chaos—and Your Sanity Goes to Die    1. Gameplay & Mechanics: A Symphony of Strategic Madness  • Unrivaled Depth: With 126 heroes (all free, no paywalls!) and 155+ items, every match unfolds like a dynamic chess match where pawns fire laser beams. Heroes range from a guitar-wielding minotaur (Spirit Breaker) to a time-bending dragon (Void Dragon), each with wildly unique abilities that synergize into thousands of viable strategies. The recent 7.39 update even added Facets—hero-specific trait customization—letting you morph a support into a carry mid-game.    • Map Mastery: Forget three-lane simplicity. Dota’s map is a tactical jungle with elevation mechanics (high ground = vision advantage), twin Roshan pits (boss monster relocates every 15 mins), and interactive objects like Wisdom Runes (XP boosts) and Lotus Pools (health/mana fruits). Jungling isn’t just killing creeps—it’s stacking camps (luring monsters to spawn extras) or blocking them with wards to sabotage enemy farms.    • Economy & Punishment: Gold loss on death? Check. Denying your own creeps to starve foes of XP? Check. Buybacks (pay to respawn instantly) that can bankrupt you? Double-check. This isn’t just resource management—it’s economic warfare where a single misclick can tilt a 50-minute game.    2. The Good: Why Dota 2 Is a Masterpiece  • Artistic Brilliance: Valve’s Source 2 engine delivers stunning visual clarity—every spell effect (e.g., Invoker’s sunstrike meteors) and hero model (e.g., Juggernaut’s Bladeform legacy) oozes polish. The free terrain skins (e.g., autumn forests, coral reefs) and 1,000+ community-made cosmetics (most under $1) let you turn heroes into steampunk pirates or disco divas.    • Tactical Freedom: Heroes defy rigid roles. A support Crystal Maiden can become a frost-nuking core with Aghanim’s Scepter. A carry Medusa can pivot into a tank with Shiva’s Guard. This flexibility fuels endless innovation—pro teams have used over 110 heroes in a single tournament meta.    • Spectator Paradise: The replay system tracks every cursor movement, skill build, and misplay, making it esports’ best learning tool. Watching TI (The International) finals feels like a blockbuster—$40M prize pools, Chinese teams reverse-sweeping Europeans, and crowd chants shaking arenas.    3. The Bad: Where Dota 2 Breaks Souls  • Vertical Learning Cliff: New players face three layers of hell:      1. Mechanical overload: Last-hitting while dodging Pudge hooks? Good luck.     2. Toxic tutors: 45% of matches feature flaming (e.g., ""uninstall, noob"") if you misplace a ward.     3. Steep mastery curve: It takes 200+ hours to grasp basics like pull timings or item counters. One wrong BKB (Black King Bar) activation? Congrats, you just fed the enemy carry.   • Snowball Suffering: Matches often spiral via ""rich get richer"" design. Lose the laning phase? Expect 20 more minutes of being chain-stunned by a farmed Phantom Assassin while teammates spam ""GG"" in chat.    • Addiction & Burnout: The average player logs 1,200+ hours—equivalent to reading War and Peace 15 times. Reddit threads are littered with cries: ""Help, I can’t stop playing!"" and ""Dota ruined my sleep schedule!"".    4. Community & Culture: The Double-Edged Sword  • Creative Utopia: The Workshop ecosystem birthed Dota Auto Chess (a genre pioneer) and absurd mods like Dota But Pokemon or CS:GO in Dota. Valve even canonizes fan designs—e.g., the ""Aegis of the Immortal"" shield became an official item.    • Toxicity Epidemic: Despite Behavior Scores (a karma system), 30% of games include griefers who:      • Pick Techies to mine allies’ jungle.      • Feed couriers (R.I.P. Gerald the llama) to enemies.      • Quote ""It’s just a game, why u heff to be mad?"" ironically.    5. Esports: Glory, Cash, and Heart Attacks  • The International (TI): Gaming’s Super Bowl + lottery jackpot. The 2023 prize pool hit $40M, funded by player-bought Battle Passes. TI moments are legendary:      • Chinese underdogs winning against 1% HP bases.      • ""The Play"": 5-hero wombo combos that break Twitch viewership records.    • Brutal Realities: Pro matches can last 5+ hours (see Azure Ray vs. G2.iG’s 334-minute marathon), demanding inhuman focus and bladder control.    Verdict: 9.5/10 – A Flawed Masterpiece  Pros Cons 🤯 Infinite replayability with meta-shaking updates 📉 Soul-crushing learning curve 🎨 Stunning art + free cosmetic economy 💀 Toxic community (mute button = MVP) ♟️ Unmatched strategic depth ⏳ Matches = time黑洞 (avg. 45 mins) 🏆 Epic esports with life-changing prizes ❄️ Snowballing defeats feel hopeless     Final Wisdom:    ""Dota 2 is like a toxic marriage: 90% suffering, 10% euphoria… and somehow you keep coming back for more."" Play it for the strategy nirvana, stay for the TI hype—but pack patience, mute buttons, and therapy funds.    ","baik"

Every match is its own small, self-contained life.    If you treat Dota as self-validation, the game owns you. That’s a diagnosis, not a hobby.

"76561198267934355","I would like to believe that this game had good intentions, never sought to intentionally harm anyone, and truly wanted to use its hour experience to create awareness towards child sexual crimes. I also believe that it can, at times, effectively disgust you, and fool you into thinking there is more to the game than its gross premise.    my d0Ooota 22  is an experience unlike any other, and it should be ashamed for it. Nobody, and certainly victims, need to be ""aware"" of the existence of child sexual assault in the manner it presents itself. Not only is it incredibly blunt in the laziest way possible, but the game immediately plays its biggest hand in the first 5 minutes when the player character, (a little girl who can be estimated to be as young as 11 years old and completely uneducated to the point her mental age seems far younger) expresses her distaste towards pills she's required to take every night because they make her tired. Immediately my eyes deceive throws all subtlety out the window, and just becomes a harrowing slog through the daily imprisonment of this poor child, and there's nothing the player can do but sit there and be complicit in the crime for another 30 minutes. And your reward for trusting the game to tell an interesting story, and going down the bad ending is a revolting line that reveals the unaware forced pregnancy of the child protagonist, only then to be given a credits scroll that attempts to empower victims, remind them they aren't alone in their experiences, and that they can always find strength in the struggle. What a gross, deaf thing to say after putting, who they would assume are victims, through this waste of time and art.    Shame on you, nouhidev, shame on you for engaging in a subject you do not understand, and taking a moral high ground on. Shame on you for wasting an hour of my life with a message that means nothing. Many people believe your game is based on the Josef Fritzl case which follows a similar story, and I am sad that anyone could believe you would be honoring the victims of Fritzl through this game. You are a depraved, blind human being who thought a post on r/TwoSentenceHorror about a falsely imprisoned child required your expert touch-ups of child molestation and drugging.    Shame on you, never make another game.    Helpful?  Yes  I have to agree that the little message in the credits is just a lame attempt at being empathetic. As someone who survived SA, yeah, cool, heard it multiple times, kind of tired of it. Kind of tired of being told I may be too sensitive to deal with fiction that deals with it too.    My issue isn't that it's ""triggering"" - it may be trying to shine a light on something that happens in reality, but it is still just fiction, and I can separate fiction from reality. My issue is that it's just kind of boring and reeks of pandering. The wait times for certain triggers are a bit too long and the keys feel ""sticky"", as if e and enter to confirm some things just don't work some times. I do appreciate there aren't any ""jump scares"" (there's a slight startle in one of the dream sequences but it's not associated with scary flashing lights, a ""scary"" face too close to the screen all of a sudden, or a truly deafening sting of any sort).    To the reviewer who says this can't help people who have gone through it, please grow up and don't police what helps people cope.

The atmosphere, the graphics, the dialogue, literally everything is so eerie, the dreams are genuinely creepy. I've played a bunch of horror games and not a lot really scared me but this is different, I don't' if i can say I was scared, just sickened. I've only unlocked one ending, the bad ending and I'm not sure if I'm gonna try to get the second one. When I first opened the game I immediately recognized what this was based off of, which makes it so much worse. The only positive thing i can say is that it was very immersive, but I wouldn't recommend it.  A twisted, dark, and engaging narrative that gradually unravels itself over the course of the experience.  Includes sensitive and distressing subject matter, including highly triggering elements such as suggested sexual abuse. It may be deeply unsettling to some players.

"76561198792509611","Dota 2: A Timeless Strategy Masterpiece  Dota 2, developed by Valve, remains one of the most compelling and complex MOBAs on the market. Its gameplay is a finely tuned balance of strategy, teamwork, and individual skill, offering a depth that few games can rival. The core mechanics—hero selection, laning, itemization, and map control—create an intricate web of decision-making where every choice can significantly impact the outcome of the match.  One of Dota 2’s most remarkable aspects is its hero diversity, with over 120 heroes, each possessing unique abilities and playstyles. This diversity ensures that no two games are ever the same, challenging players to adapt constantly. Furthermore, the game rewards strategic synergy, both in hero composition and in real-time coordination, emphasizing communication and foresight.  The metagame in Dota 2 evolves continuously, driven by patches and professional tournaments. This constant evolution keeps high-level play fresh and encourages players to refine their skills perpetually. The learning curve is steep, which may intimidate newcomers, but for those willing to invest time, the depth of mastery is immensely satisfying.  Graphically, Dota 2 delivers a visually appealing experience without compromising performance, making it accessible across a wide range of hardware. The sound design, from hero voice lines to environmental cues, adds layers of tactical feedback and immersion.  In conclusion, Dota 2 is not just a game—it’s a strategic battleground that rewards intelligence, teamwork, and adaptability. Its complexity is both its greatest strength and its challenge, creating a competitive experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is thrilling. For players seeking a game that combines strategic depth with competitive intensity, Dota 2 remains unmatched.  Score: 9.5/10","baik"

The game was plenty complicated then too, but in a more natural way","baik"

"76561199179532393","Dota 2 is my favorite game, not because of teamwork, but because I get to babysit four feral monkeys who just discovered a keyboard and instantly developed every known mental illness. Every match feels like I’m running a daycare inside a burning mental hospital while being blamed for the fire. I suffer, I cry, I lose, I uninstall. And then, like a goldfish with brain damage, I reinstall as if it’s my very first time playing.  Sometimes, I feel genuine joy when I delete someone by spamming Q as Sniper. Other times, I deal negative damage because my projectiles have turned into marshmallows, and I get beaten so badly it feels like I accidentally signed up for the UFC.  I’ve only played four hours of this sacred, polished turd, yet I’ve already developed a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome, and Valve is keeping me hostage. 11/10, would absolutely love to lose my sanity again to a small squirrel beating me senseless with a walnut","baik"

"76561198913752431","Dota 2 is an incredibly captivating and unique game that delivers tons of emotions and pure adrenaline. The atmosphere of team battles, deep strategy, variety of heroes, and the feeling of victory after a tough match all create an experience that’s hard to find elsewhere.  At the same time, this game can really drain your nerves. Dota 2 is highly emotional: one mistake can cost you the entire match, and the team dynamics can sometimes be more exhausting than the gameplay itself. Often, you finish a match feeling like you’ve worked a full shift.  Overall, Dota 2 is a game of contrasts: it brings both immense joy and serious stress. If you’re ready for an emotional rollercoaster, it’s one of the best choices among team-based online games.","baik"

"76561198071631744","With over 3168 hours in Dota 2, about 75% of my time has been spent playing Position 5 support — and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I thrive in the role of enabling my team, securing vision, protecting cores, and making clutch saves that can turn the tide of a game. Playing support has taught me the importance of map awareness, resource efficiency, and strong communication. I take pride in reading the flow of the game, knowing when to sacrifice and when to step up.  Support might not always get the spotlight, but for me, it's where the game is won — through foresight, discipline, and making the team shine. Dota 2 has been as much a mental challenge as it has been a test of teamwork and patience, and I’ve loved every moment of it.","baik"

"76561198254728144","I’ve played a lot of games, but Dota 2 hits differently. It’s not just a game—it’s a mix of frustration, adrenaline, and pure satisfaction.    When I first started, I honestly felt lost. The mechanics, items, and hero skills were overwhelming. One mistake could cost the whole team, and that pressure was tough. But over time, I realized that’s exactly what makes Dota 2 special. Every match is unique, every hero is different, and every decision matters.    The best part for me is the teamwork and strategy. When my squad coordinates well—pulling off a perfect gank or clutch defense—it feels like magic. Of course, not every game is perfect. The toxicity is real, and matches can drag on for an hour. But when you finally win after a hard-fought battle, the victory is way more rewarding than most games I’ve played.    I also love the esports side of Dota 2. Watching The International and seeing pro players pull off insane plays makes me want to grind and improve.    For me, Dota 2 is more than just a hobby—it’s a challenge that keeps me coming back. It’s hard, it’s stressful, but it’s also the most satisfying multiplayer game I’ve ever played.","baik"

"76561198078647508","Dota 2 – The Game I Hate to Love ❤️💔    Dota 2 will ruin your mood, test your patience, and drain your free time... and somehow, you’ll keep coming back.    No pay-to-win, just pure skill, strategy, and stress. Every match is a mental chess game with fireworks — one second you're a god, the next you're reported by 4 strangers.    🔥 1000+ hours in, and I’m still learning.  💀 I’ve uninstalled more times than I’d like to admit.  😢 No Battle Pass this year? Huge letdown. The magic just isn’t the same without it.    But when that perfect teamfight hits, when you carry with 10 HP, or land the game-winning spell... nothing else compares.

"76561199812076286","Dota will make you grieve, angry, resentful, raging(oh it's a harder version of angry), sad, vengeful, and hateful. But if that happens then seek therapy or a really nice long hug from your favorite loved one who loves you dearly, cause you're gonna need it. It may make one evil. Don't let it. It's just a game. Comes down to people and the warping of the soul and mind over nothing. Best to play with 4  of your most wonderful forgiving friends. If not, either go silent mode or mute the ones who are not being wise or smart about their intentions of game play and rather insult you to no end. Look at it this way, they are suffering if they act like that. You do not have to share in their torment on bit. Mute button actually works quite nicely. If insulted keep playing, even though it does not rub off your shoulder for awhile just put it in the basement and let it rot while you strategize your next move. Over time, you might become immune to the darkness that may entail after playing so long. You are more than darkness. Dota is great for casual gamers who visit on occasion knowing it is not thier favorite game to play. Hardcore Roshan battlers will need to keep cool and calm after long sessions due to matchmaking having to make sacrifices due to lacking same skilled level and disruptive players. Not easy, but there is something that is old and new one can use in such circumstances and that is...take a Break. Go for a walk. You get the idea. Life is too short for nonsense. But playing Dota does not have to be. Good Luck Have Fun.","baik"

"76561198322379889","Dota 2 is one of the most rewarding and punishing team-based competitive games ever made. With its staggering depth, relentless learning curve, and fiercely balanced free-to-play model, it demands dedication but offers unmatched strategic variety. Rooted in its origins as a mod for Warcraft III, Dota 2 has evolved into a complex multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) that requires significant time and effort to master.    A Trial by Fire  New players face a brutal introduction: over 100 heroes, intricate mechanics, and a meta that shifts with every patch. Early matches can feel overwhelming, but perseverance reveals a brilliantly layered game where knowledge and teamwork trump reflexes alone. Key mechanics include:    Denying: Players can kill their own creeps (AI units) to prevent enemies from gaining experience and gold. This strategic move is crucial for controlling the lane and starving opponents.    Hero Roles: Understanding hero roles is vital. For instance, hypercarry heroes scale well into the late game, becoming powerful threats, while soft supports provide utility and vision without needing much gold. In contrast, strong supports can initiate fights and protect carries, ensuring they survive to deal damage.    Lanes: The game features three main lanes: top, middle (mid), and bottom. The mid lane is often contested for its central position, allowing heroes to gain experience quickly and rotate to assist other lanes.    Pure, Uncompromising Balance  Valve’s commitment to fairness is unmatched—every hero is free, and only cosmetics are monetized. This focus on skill fosters a competitive purity that is rare in free-to-play titles. Players must learn intricate mechanics, hero interactions, and strategies to succeed, making skill and teamwork paramount.    A Living, Evolving Game  Regular updates, pro-level spectating, and community-driven content keep Dota 2 fresh. While some design choices feel outdated, such as finicky tower targeting, Valve’s polish and anti-toxicity measures make the game more welcoming than ever—though playing with friends remains the best experience.    Game Mechanics Overview  Vision: Control of vision is critical in Dota 2. Players use wards to gain sight over key areas, allowing for strategic positioning and ambushes. Proper vision can turn the tide of battles and prevent ganks.    Itemization: With numerous items available, players must adapt their builds based on the game state and enemy heroes. Items can enhance stats, provide active abilities, or counter specific threats, adding another layer of strategy.    Team Composition: Successful teams often balance their composition with a mix of damage dealers, supports, and initiators. Understanding how these roles interact is essential for executing strategies effectively.    Dota 2 isn’t for casual players it requires a significant time investment to enjoy fully. However, for those willing to climb its steep learning curve, it delivers endless depth, adrenaline-pumping matches, and a fiercely fair competitive landscape. A masterpiece of the genre—if you dare to master it. May the best team win!","baik"

"76561198035853026","Love Dota 2. It has so much depth and complexity. At first, I was turned off by the idea that it would take me possibly 100s of hours to learn it, but after playing a few games, I did start to understand it. As a former League of Legends player, I can grasp the moba fundamentals in Dota 2 easily, however there are significant differences between the two.   Dota 2 may seem slower, but man, wait till you get flash ganked by an Earthshaker and perma-stunned then 0-100 in a couple of seconds. There is fight commitment here, and the visuals are excellent. It also doesn't have many skill shots, so positioning and strategy is key. Another fundamental difference is that most items are not passive stat sticks, they do provide stats but also come with game changing actives, that can dictate the flow of combat. It is quite possibly the most glaring difference between Dota 2 and LOL. In Dota 2, we buy items for extra abilities essentially.

"76561198393942753","One of the best, most strategic, most intense competitive games ever made.… if your team isn’t the enemy  Every match is unique, the hero pool is insanely deep, and the skill ceiling is basically infinite. When you play with friends, especially a full 5-stack, the game can be pure magic — coordinated fights, smart plays, actual teamwork. It’s one of the most satisfying multiplayer experiences out there.  But... if you're playing solo, good luck. Dota 2’s community is infamous for a reason. Expect fragile egos, instant blame, rage picks, and people who think they’re the next Miracle after getting one triple kill. Playing solo queue is like flipping a coin — maybe you get a decent team, or maybe you're stuck with a keyboard warrior screaming in chat and griefing from 10 minutes in.  Play it at your own risk, and if you can, bring a full party.  Recommended for masochists, and those with noise-cancelling headphones.","baik"

"76561198914380165","I’ve been a long-time fan and player of Dota 2, and I truly appreciate the depth, strategy, and teamplay the game continues to offer. The hero diversity, gameplay mechanics, and regular updates make it a standout experience among competitive games.  However, I would like to respectfully share some concerns regarding the current state of matchmaking—particularly on the Asia server. Lately, I’ve noticed that the matchmaking quality has significantly declined, leading to unbalanced games, long queue times, and frequent mismatches in player skill levels. This can be discouraging, especially when you're trying to enjoy a fair and competitive environment.  I understand the challenges involved in maintaining a global matchmaking system, and I appreciate the effort the developers put in. Still, I hope the team can look into improving matchmaking fairness and consistency in the Asia region. A more balanced system would greatly enhance the experience for players who are passionate about the game.  Thank you for your continued work on Dota 2. I look forward to seeing how the game evolves and hope to see improvements in this area in the near future.","baik"

Constant micro-decisions: creep equilibrium, power spike timings, vision placement.    Infinite room for personal growth, even after 8 years.    You’ve likely felt how every patch changes macro strategies (tempo pushes, zoo, hypercarry meta, slow siege) forcing adaptation, which keeps it fresh but can feel exhausting.","baik"
"76561199198432934","Dota 2 is a 5v5 battle of strategy, skill, and intense emotional trauma.    You pick from over 120 heroes, each with their own crazy abilities — some heal, some nuke, and some just ruin lives (looking at you, Techies). The first 10 minutes are farming and pretending you know what you're doing, and the next 40 are chaotic team fights, blaming supports, and yelling “WHY DIDN’T YOU BKB!?”    It's hard to find a team that vibes, plays well, and doesn’t scream at you for missing a stun. But the teamwork, the clutch plays, the feeling of turning a fight with 10 HP and a well-timed Black Hole — chef’s kiss.    In conclusion: Dota 2 is a toxic relationship you can’t quit. It’ll break your heart, melt your brain, and still have you queuing up again at 2 a.m. because “this time we’ll win for sure.”","baik"

"76561198123495659","It always feels weird to recommend a MOBA. Its one of those joy sucking hobbies that nobody seems to actually enjoy doing.     However, my recent engagement with DOTA 2 as a long time MOBA player has shown to me that the Sandbox MOBA is the only really engaging way to maintain a game.     League of Legends is miserable because you can do everything right in regards to your role and still eat shit. Mainly because of the rigidity the League formula has. Its constantly telling you what to do, when to do it, where to do it. What have you been doing well, what have you been doing poorly. It leaves a stale taste in the mouth.     I enjoy a bit of League now and then, don't get me wrong. I don't want this to come across as a League bad Dota good review. But honestly, at the end of the day. That is sort of the conclusion I've come to. Dota has such a sandbox to play in that feels infinitely more dynamic than anything League has produced. Objectives are weird and abstract in a way that feels like it puts agency in the hands of the player. There is no get 10 DMG permanently enemy on the map that teams are told to stack at specific intervals.     The way trees are entities engage with like Treant and Nature Prophet, while others destroy and create new pathways and open fields like Primal beast. These things are what makes the sandbox unique and dynamic. Picking a timbersaw isn't just about being the tree chopping guy against the tree hero. Its about being able to fundamentally change the playing field to counter a playstyle.     That's what makes Dota unique for me.     What I would criticize Dota for in comparison to other mobas is the sort of hard countering that often goes around. There are certain matchups that are borderline unwinnable for characters, and this HAS gotten better over the years. No more 99% magic resist Huskarr into a magic carry type situations. However, there are still cases where some heroes just lock out other heroes from participating, and you'll often have one guy on your team and the enemy team who is essentially not allowed to play the game. Other MOBAs like League do HAVE counters, but they are more favorable matchups than they are win buttons as often the case in Dota. What is a Dark Seer to do when a Faceless Void warps and ults him and his team before beating his face into the dirt with half an item to his name? A lot of the time its just hope someone has a setup to counter the counter. And that's not always a fun way to play. It makes BKB a mandatory item that you will always see at least one of in every single game. League somewhat mitigates this hard countering by significantly reducing the length of CC in its game, that way people have to consider more where and when its used and what they can do while its happening. While often in Dota 2 simply landing a stun can often be a guaranteed kill regardless of positioning because of how long many stuns last.     Even with these criticisms, I still find Dota 2 much more fun than its competition.","baik"

Only jungle if you can carry Ancients creeps after laning phase.   -If your control the vision of the map, you control the destiny of the teamfights  -If your support, do your job: offer vision to your team and protection for your carry and tanks while they bank those LH. Dont try to get LH, focus on harassing and denying creeps.   -Follow the high rated guides and dont be shy to ask your teammates for tips, you cant be worst then a bot.

"76561199084204185","By the time of writing this i have 200 hours playtime, played every character a-tleast once and done my ranked placement. This is as good of a feel for Dota as you can get without no-lifing it for 5 years.  Dota like many valve games I've played feels like a more chaotic version of other games in it's genre. unlike other MOBA's it doesn't care as much about balance, and will happily make all the characters insanely overpowered compared to peoples defensives (even with bkb and a full item list of defensives). This makes Teamfights turn into a 5v5 of glass cannons no matter the build, all capable of killing eachother in less than 3 seconds which makes split second descisions more heavily weighted. The lack of many skillshots means that (unlike league of legends) the idea of strafing between attacks just doesn't exist. From my limited experience, most teamfights will have the carry be invisible or hidden until the fight starts, then stand still and burst the enemy team. This isn't nessecarily a critique but it does sometimes mean you find yourself in situations you cant save. for example an ulted sven who is invisible stunning you means you are just dead, there is no counter, in 2 hits he will kill you.  The controls need to be reworked, there's too much clutter with the 7 item buttons, 5 ability buttons and buttons for controlling different units for those with summons. For the most part this is unfixable as so many characters like meepo would no longer work but it causes such a large skill gap between 90% of the characters and the few who have multiple summons only for them to be just as balanced as the significantly easier ones.  With the 2 big outliers out the way here's some positives and negatives compared to other MOBAs:  Positive:  + The courier system is genius and so is their way of using teleport scrolls, although I would personally not price teleport scrolls and instead make it a cooldown, otherwise it feels like being punished for good positioning. + The idea of making trees destroyable makes for some interesting moments, you can elevate vision to your liking. + The store is brilliant. Most skins you can earn passively and over 200 hours i spent $8 for a total of 24 skins, as most skins would go for 20 pence on the steam market. + come backs are much easier than league, but lanes are much staler with the lack of a designated jungler who is ganking lanes at all times. You have the option to roam at any time, or go to another lane but you're never encouraged to do it for long other than teamfights at your tower. + The idea of Aghnims shard and sceptre is brilliant and the idea that you can buy a buff to abilities, although i feel like every champion should be incentivised to get at least one, and have the difference between them be at what stage of the game they buy it. for some characters it feels like an actual debuff getting sceptre.  Negatives:  - the ranked system is incredibly predatory, don't even consider trying it. Rank confidence means you must play on a weekly basis for a fair MR each game and the initial placement goes off normal pick MR. if you mostly played turbo like me, grats kid your fucked go to crusader (gold in most games). - Vision is broken. no matter your skill level its too inconsistent as its using light rendering on the assets, which from your camera perspective makes it impossible to guess the sight-lines for. The concept of hiding in the environment is cool, but it just doesn't work here. There's no UI to show if you've been spotted while invisible which means you walk right up to enemies that can see you some times. - The jungle is boring, while i see the need for so many camps for characters like chen to be interesting, it just means the majority of the map is boring. lotuses are a cool idea however because it adds a mini control area for both teams to fight over. - Roshan is boring, hit item is boring. Compared to team buffs like in league it gives your carry the most boring affect possible. - Stats are completely broken. unlike in league where you can easily pick to have more health, or more armour you instead go for items with effects. most of them are boring but also required for a lot of characters, and you're even encouraged to get items with  stats that don't benefit you if it means you get the effect. the only benefit to items in dota is the damage stat, because it means every character gets some value from damage items, meaning carries have more options and don't need to buy e.g. ability power only items.  Overall its got some great additions to MOBA's but there's a lot of outdated ideas in it which need to be reworked.","baik"

On the one hand, there is a large selection of heroes and their abilities, a large selection of weapons, tactics and strategy.

"76561198001595249","Dota 2: A Masterclass in Masochism    Ah yes, Dota 2 — the game that truly understands the modern player’s desire to suffer. Why unwind after a long day when you can have your soul slowly crushed over 45-minute matches with strangers who communicate exclusively through pings and slurs?    The learning curve? A gentle vertical wall lined with spikes. You’re not playing a game — you’re attempting a doctorate in pain. And the heroes? With over 120 characters, each with abilities designed to specifically ruin your day, picking the ""wrong"" one guarantees a personal essay in all-chat about your intelligence, ancestry, and life choices.    And let's talk about matchmaking! There's something magical about being paired with a guy named “420NoscopeFeedr” who picks Techies, buys four couriers, and then vanishes into the jungle. Truly, peak competitive balance.    Of course, no Dota 2 experience would be complete without the community. A delightful blend of cryptic philosophers, part-time psychologists, and emotionally unstable warlords. If you're ever feeling too confident or mentally well, just hop into a solo queue match and let the existential dread wash over you.    In conclusion, Dota 2 is perfect — if your idea of fun involves emotional whiplash, aggressive typing, and spending hundreds of hours to improve only slightly before being told to uninstall.    10/10 would cry again.","baik"

I now walk the earth as a husk—emotionally bankrupt, chronically sleep-deprived, and fluent in five dialects of Russian rage.    This isn’t a game. It’s a lifestyle, a second job, a religion, and a prison sentence—all coded into a 50-minute match that you think you're winning until your carry buys a Divine Rapier and dies in front of Roshan at 54:12.    Every match is a fresh trauma. Every teammate is a philosopher-warrior-poet with the emotional stability of a house of cards in a wind tunnel. One day you're a god, last-hitting with surgical precision. The next, you're being reported for existing.    I recommend Dota 2 to anyone who:    Has too much happiness    Wants to understand true hatred    Misses the feeling of betrayal    Wants to yell “MID OR FEED” in a trench coat at 2AM    This game took my time, my peace, my trust in humanity—and I keep coming back, willingly. Why? Because that one perfect Black Hole, that one Rampage, that sweet, sweet victory after 72 minutes of chaos... it makes it all worth it. Briefly.    10/10.

"76561198218938831","**Dota 2** is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve. It’s the spiritual successor to the original *Defense of the Ancients* (DotA), a mod for *Warcraft III*, and it’s one of the most iconic titles in competitive gaming.    Here’s the gist:  - Two teams of **five players** each—Radiant and Dire—battle to destroy the enemy’s **Ancient**, a heavily guarded structure at the heart of their base.  - Each player controls a **hero**, a unique character with distinct abilities and roles. There are over 120 heroes, and no two are quite the same.  - The game unfolds on a single map divided into **three lanes**, with a jungle area in between. Players earn **gold and experience** by defeating enemy units and heroes, which they use to level up and buy powerful items.  - Strategy, timing, and teamwork are everything. A well-timed spell or a clever ambush can turn the tide of battle.    Dota 2 is known for its **steep learning curve**, but also for its **depth and complexity**. It’s a game where every match feels different, and mastery can take years. It also boasts one of the largest esports scenes in the world, with *The International* tournament offering prize pools in the tens of millions.","baik"

"76561199829835316","Few games have shaped the esports landscape as profoundly as Dota 2. Developed by Valve, this free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) stands as a towering giant in competitive gaming—complex, rewarding, and fiercely strategic.    At its core, Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other in a battle to destroy the opposing team’s Ancient, a heavily guarded structure deep within their base. With over a hundred unique heroes, each boasting distinct abilities, playstyles, and roles, no two matches feel the same.    The game balances macromanagement of the battlefield with micromanagement of your hero’s growth—you’ll be farming gold, buying items, coordinating with teammates, ganking enemies, and executing game-changing team fights. It’s a demanding dance of skill, strategy, and split-second decision-making.    Dota 2 is notoriously complex. Its steep learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, but the depth is precisely what has kept the community thriving for years. Every patch introduces balance changes, new items, and sometimes new heroes, ensuring the meta continually evolves.    Mastering one hero, let alone the entire roster, requires time and dedication—but the satisfaction of outplaying an opponent or turning the tide in a crucial moment is unparalleled.    Visually, Dota 2 is colorful and detailed, with each hero uniquely animated and designed to stand out. The maps are richly textured, providing clear tactical information while remaining aesthetically pleasing. Sound design is top-notch, with distinct voice lines, spell effects, and ambient noises contributing to the immersive experience.    With one of the largest esports scenes globally, Dota 2’s The International tournament offers multi-million-dollar prize pools and draws millions of viewers worldwide. The community is passionate, vocal, and dedicated, though the competitive nature can sometimes lead to a steep social environment.    Dota 2 is a monument to strategic depth and player skill—a game that rewards patience, teamwork, and creativity. If you’re willing to invest the time, it offers a rich, endlessly evolving battlefield where every match is a new story.    Complex, competitive, and compelling—Dota 2 remains the pinnacle of MOBA excellence.    Rating: 9/10","baik"

"76561198169132859","When I first jumped into Dota 2, I was completely overwhelmed. I had played other MOBAs before, but Dota 2 felt like a different beast entirely. The depth of the game, the variety of heroes, and the sheer amount of strategies felt daunting. I remember getting wrecked in my early games, and there were moments I seriously considered uninstalling it.  But there’s something about Dota 2 that keeps pulling you back in. It's that perfect blend of strategy, team coordination, and individual skill. Every game feels different. Sure, there are repetitive moments, like the early laning phase or defending against pushers, but no two matches ever play out the same way. Some games you’ll find yourself in an epic comeback, and others, you’ll lose in a crushing defeat, but every single match leaves you with something to learn.  The complexity is a double-edged sword though. At first, it’s kind of like being thrown into the deep end of a pool, and you’re just flailing around trying to stay afloat. But the more you play, the more the game opens up. Mastering last-hitting, understanding item builds, and learning how to actually be a valuable team player (not just a solo god) is incredibly satisfying.  Hero Selection: The best part of the game for me is the hero variety. There’s a hero for every playstyle, and finding your niche feels like discovering an old friend. I went from playing characters that just “clicked” (like Phantom Assassin or Anti-Mage) to appreciating support heroes (like Crystal Maiden or Dazzle), which I never thought I’d enjoy. Being the guy who saves the team with the clutch heal or disable feels pretty damn rewarding.  The game can be ridiculously frustrating though. The learning curve is steep, and it’s easy to get stuck in a cycle of bad games. The community? Yeah, it can be toxic. The in-game chat gets heated, and sometimes it feels like the pressure of winning just makes everyone a little more on edge. That’s definitely one of the downsides, especially when you're just trying to play for fun.  The Esports Scene: As someone who’s not huge into traditional sports, watching The International or any major Dota 2 tournament is a whole different experience. There’s an insane amount of skill on display, and when you see some of the best teams and players coordinate team fights or execute a perfect strategy, it’s like watching art in motion. It’s not just a game at that point, it’s a showcase of the best in the world.  Time Investment: Dota 2 is not a “quick gaming fix.” Some of my most memorable games have lasted over an hour, and every minute feels tense. I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t frustrating to have a match go sideways after investing so much time, but when the game clicks and you have a well-executed victory? It’s one of the most satisfying feelings.  Final Thoughts: At the end of the day, Dota 2 is one of those games that I love to hate and hate to love. I’ve spent hours on it, and while I’ve had my fair share of rage-quitting moments, there’s something that always pulls me back. The depth of strategy, the thrill of learning new heroes, and the satisfaction of improving my gameplay are things that I haven’t found in many other games.  Is it frustrating? Yes. Is it rewarding? Absolutely. Dota 2 is a game that tests you, but if you’re into deep strategy and don’t mind grinding your way through frustration, it’s one of the most satisfying experiences in the gaming world.  Would I recommend it? If you’re willing to commit the time, patience, and mental energy, absolutely. But if you’re just looking for something casual, it might not be the best pick.","baik"

One minute you’re coordinating the perfect teamfight, the next you’re questioning your life choices after a disastrous throw. It’s brutal, it’s punishing, and somehow, it’s still incredibly rewarding. There’s something addictive about the depth of this game — the endless strategies, the hero pool, the meta shifts, the synergy between teammates (or lack thereof). Even when I rage-quit, I find myself queuing up again, chasing that one perfect game. Dota 2 isn’t for everyone. It can be toxic, frustrating, and deeply unforgiving. But for those who stick with it, it’s also one of the most complex and satisfying competitive experiences out there. Love it or hate it, or both at once. Dota 2 is a game that leaves a mark. And for better or worse, I’m hooked.","baik"

"76561198020365261","Ah, Dota 2. The game I love to hate and hate to love. 7,670.9 hours of my life have disappeared into this beautiful, frustrating void, and what do I have to show for it? A shiny Archon badge that mocks me every time I log in.  Let's start with the good, shall we? The depth of strategy in this game is unparalleled. With over 100 heroes, each with unique abilities, and a dizzying array of items, the possibilities are endless. Every match feels like a new puzzle to solve, a fresh challenge to overcome. The thrill of a well-executed team fight or a game-winning play? Pure dopamine.  But oh boy, the frustration. You'd think after nearly 7,700 hours, I'd be sitting pretty in the Divine ranks, right? WRONG. I'm still duking it out in the trenches of Archon and Legend, wondering if I'll ever see the promised land of Ancient. It's like being stuck in a time loop, but instead of Groundhog Day, it's Grounds for Uninstalling Day... except I never do.  The community? A mixed bag of wholesome teammates who restore your faith in humanity, and toxic players who make you question why you even bother. It's like a social experiment gone wrong, but somehow, I keep coming back for more.  And let's not forget the patches. Just when you think you've got the meta figured out, BAM! IceFrog drops a new update that turns everything on its head. Suddenly, your favorite hero is trash, and that hero you never touched is the new hotness. It's exciting and infuriating in equal measure.  Yet, despite all the rage quits, the ""cyka blyat"" spam, and the crushing defeats, there's something magical about Dota 2 that keeps pulling me back in. Maybe it's the hope that the next game will be THE game where everything clicks. Or perhaps I'm just a glutton for punishment.  So here I am, 7,670.9 hours deep, still chasing that Ancient dream. Will I ever get there? Who knows. But one thing's for sure - I'll be spending another 7,000 hours trying.  If you value your social life, your sleep schedule, or your sanity, stay far, far away from Dota 2. But if you're ready for a wild ride that will simultaneously be the best and worst gaming experience of your life, welcome to the club. I'll see you in the trenches of matchmaking... probably still sporting my Archon badge.","buruk"
"76561199391981562","The game itself is absolutely amazing and one of the best gaming experiences out there.   Sadly, the community that you have to immerse yourself in does not deserve/warrant that you spend your time, sanity and well-being in there. Toxicity is rampant. Quite literally every 1-2 games there is minimum one teammate actively griefing, trying their best to make your team lose, destroying items, AFK, cursing at everyone over voice comms or caps lock wishing cancer to you and your family. You cannot leave games, so you are forced to sit through the entire game and try your best to win despite the handicap and the absolutely toxic environment, it is simply not worth playing anymore...  Very little is done to punish wrongdoers, the punishment is way too soft. Doing Overwatch cases (you act as a judge) and seeing all the ways in which people willingly disrupt games and win chances makes you question the very fabric of human beings (or at least those addicted to this game). Stay away at all costs.","buruk"

"76561198022256662","This game is awful, its toxic, the skill floor of this game is a mountain cliff, and the skill ceiling is infinite.

It's overly complicated, it's the game that is affected by skill inflation the most, its ruthless, its insanely toxic, and i regret every second i wasted on this game. No matter how much Valve tries to ease the skill floor with a bunch of QoL such as showing wards vision range or showing crowd control bars on enemies, this game will always be dota, and dota is for people that hate themselves and brings the worst in people.  If you are a new player, this game is impenetrable. Expect to lose the game in 15 minutes, and wait another 30 minutes by watching your base slowly crumpling, and getting fountain farmed to oblivion.  it's not fun to stomp, its not fun to get stomped, and it has e-sports mentality all over it, it is the most tryhard game in the market, Stay the heck away from this ruthless sweatland game.

Valve likes money and if a person is willing to swipe for an account/account boost they are most likely going to be willing to sub to DotA+ and buy skins.  DotA+ is another very big bait in my opinion depending on what you're buying it for. I bought it only for the predicted match quality and the ability to avoid people. Most of the games that had ""Ideal"" predicted match quality ended up in a hard one-sided stomp.  The game itself is amazing but it has become cancer to play due to an insane amount of people playing the game at a certain rank who do not belong there and just waste everybody else's time.  Do not get addicted like myself, skip until Valve decides to give real people jobs to deal with acc buyers/acc boost buyers and not rely on their community to identify them while wasting their time playing with the same people.","buruk"

"76561198120223786","Negative Review of Dota 2    Dota 2 is one of the most overrated and toxic games I have ever encountered. Despite years of existence and Valve’s enormous resources, the game remains incredibly frustrating, mentally exhausting, and often unfair in every possible way.    1. Terrible Community  One of the main reasons people quit Dota 2 is its community. It is truly toxic: in almost every game, there is at least one player who either deliberately ruins the match or insults the entire team. The report system is practically useless—griefers and toxic players go unpunished, while you can get muted just for asking your team to play cooperatively.    2. Extremely High Learning Curve  Even if you want to learn the game, are willing to invest time, and try to understand the mechanics, Dota 2 doesn’t make it easy for you. There is no proper tutorial, and the sheer amount of information you need to memorize is overwhelming. Moreover, even if you become a skilled player, that doesn’t mean you’ll win—too much depends on teammates and pure luck.    3. Balance is a Myth  Heroes are either too strong or completely useless. Every patch shifts the meta so drastically that you have to relearn everything. Some heroes stay unplayable for months, making it pointless to invest time mastering them, as they may become irrelevant in just a couple of updates.    4. Matchmaking is a Lottery  The ranking system in Dota 2 is another source of frustration. Matchmaking works in such a way that sometimes you get a team that plays perfectly, and sometimes you get players who have no understanding of the game’s basics. There is no balance between teams, and your wins or losses are more dependent on luck than skill.    5. A Waste of Time  To make any real progress, you need to invest hundreds of hours, yet even after that, you won’t necessarily enjoy the game. Every match is either stressful or disappointing, and the feeling of satisfaction is extremely rare.    Conclusion  Dota 2 may seem interesting at first, but in reality, it drains your time, nerves, and energy. It is a game for those who are willing to endure toxicity, unbalanced mechanics, and frustration. If you’re looking for fun, it’s best to stay far away from this chaos.","buruk"

"76561198120649165","Maybe time to say goodbye.   Dota 2 is the best competitive game you can find right now, unbeatable in its genre. Unfortunately it also has the most toxic player base in the gaming industry by a huge margin. It's almost impossible to play a whole game without at least one player goes on a tantrum for absolutely no reason and ruin the match for everyone. Playing Dota is a long streak of frustrations, disappointments, insults and disruptive behaviors with sprinkles of fun and satisfaction here and there. After more than a decade of getting on and off, as time goes by I can see more and more clearly how mentally unhealthy the whole experience is, and today I finally made the decision to not return.   It's been a good run.","buruk"

"76561198047333591","Impressions are purely based on nearly 200 unranked games, but by god is Dota 2 one brilliant video game with one incompetent developer and millions of players who don't deserve access to anything made after 19th century.  I wish I could enjoy it because the actual game part is brilliant. It quite the first of its kind, but it definitely defined and popularized it, and it's easy to see why. They took the fun of hero characters in RTS games, amplified it tenfold, and then built a whole game around it. Every match you have a lot of decisions to make that vary drastically based on the state of the game, team compositions, economy, individual player builds and playstyles, etc. Even the characters themselves are so diverse, and I think this is the biggest leg up it has over the competition. Gameplay itself can shift so much from character to character that it's almost understandable why some sickos pick one flavor and the eat nothing but that for thousands of hours.  It's also an almost paradoxical game where both hero and system overall enable a great amount of skill expression, yet proper teamwork and coordination are still important to an extent that you rarely actually see in team based multiplayer games. It's also one game where ""nobody is broken when everyone is"" really does feel accurate. In the right hands and with the right items, pretty much every character can do things that will make you think ""well, that's some bull****,"" yet there is often a powerful counter to it, a way to play around it, or something equally bull that every other character can pull off. Dota 2 *feels* loose in every element of its design, yet when you look closer at any of those elements, you start seeing thin but unbreakable connection that weave the fabric that Dota is made of.  Even in terms of visuals and storytelling I like more about it than I would expect from a MOBA. There's a lot of lore to explore, and while much of it is lacking, and Valve is sort of just sitting on it, it feels like whoever is responsible for putting it all together still cares deeply about the universe that this game is set it, and Crownfall is hopefully first of many examples of what can be done with it.   The only caveat here is that Valve also has some of the soulless, greediest monetization practices, and very low standards for maintaining the visual integrity of the games they created. All the fine craftsmanship that was put into creating the art style of TF2 was smeared with crap once lootbox money started rolling in. CS mostly resisted this, because cosmetics used to be limited to only weapons, but Dota 2 art style also went down the drain. Anything is permitted, and the more offensively tasteless it looks, the more rare and expensive it is.   The base characters all have their charm in some way. I understand that they aren't to everyone's taste. Many of them lack maybe one or two features that would make them feel like a ""main character,"" which is something that I feel a lot of hero based games chase after. All of them are just a bit too plain or simple to fit that role. You have dozens of dudes in armor of various colors and sizes, but it weirdly appeals to me that no individual character feels too ""special"" I guess?   That was all thrown out the moment Valve smelled money. Now you can spend an unreasonable amount of money in order to turn your unremarkable mook into a high level MU Online whale. It's funny because Valve still has those brilliant cosmetics guidelines for people who want to make something, but they haven't cares about what is said there for years. Silhouettes? Who cares. Glance value? Dude, just remember that this pile of pixels is Sniper. The arcanas are especially offensive, because they advertise extra crap as a selling point. Most Dota 2 chars emit zero lights or particles, some sets will give you clouds, glowing gems, arcs of lightning, buzzling flies or orbiting stars, excess is the goal over something coherent or appealing, and the community happily eats it up. Perhaps they don't even care about the look, since all of this is connected to the real money marketplace that enables gambling addicts, whales, and kids who think they can make money by playing their favorite video game.  Anyway, Valve happily enabling gambling aside, one of the main things that makes this game harder to enjoy is the quality of matchmaking and moderation. I have a succesful griefing report for pretty much every single day that I played, and to give you an idea, that doesn't even include a case where we had a willow that stood AFK in the fountain and sent our her courier to die, I guess that didn't count or something. Griefers would be one thing, but there's also so many accounts that are merely days old but obviously aren't remotely new to Dota. If it all it takes to avoid smurf que is to occasionally throw a game, then I'm not sure Valve understands the point of smurf que. Finally even ignoring these two points that already ruin 90% of my matches, the game loves to put new and old players together. I don't care if MMR is similar, a Zeus with 12k wins will be stronger than (non-smurfing) Zeus qith 20 games under their belt, it makes no sense to not take player count into account.  Maybe ranked would've resolved some of my woes, but you need 100 in-game hours to even gain access to that. It took me well over 150 matches to get to that point. I'm not sure if Dota players understand this, but the point of ranked isn't just to stroke your ego and to achieve the highest number/icon possible. It's there to enable fair matches between equally matched opponents. If someone is new and bad, they will be put up against other new and bad players, that's good.  ""But it keeps smurfs out"" please reconsider even attempting to think that this makes sense. More dedicated smurfs are buying accounts and paying boosters to get whatever they want, Valve is exceptionally bad at handling that too. More stingy ones are then thrown into unranked with players who could've been playing ranked, and I'm not sure too many of them are willing to endure low quality matches for 100 hours before they are allowed to experience something more tolerable. It's really a shame. Under more caring developer, Dota 2 could've been a fantastic experience.","buruk"

The draw to this piece of shit is unlike anything I've felt in this life. Nothing can compare to the shear dread and misery that becomes of my soul when I click that green play button.

The game is literally designed to create addiction and fuel their monthly battle pass subscription service. Hackers run rampant and if you somehow overcome the odds and begin to win, the game studies you, adapts, and then overcomes you.  How does it overcome you? Many ways, let's name a few: Opponents cheat, your team are bots, you play on ""North America"" server but all your team are from foreign lands speaking everything but English, your team are toxic/griefers, the mmr is hidden and pairs you with wide ""skill"" gap teammates vs Seal Team 6.  Let's examine some red flags: The worst and best players in dota vary in winrate from 46 percent to 54 percent until you hit your ""true"" mmr!  Watch people use their ""mmr"" as some kind of badge or medal defining their worth while seamlessly making plays worse than any ""Herald"" low rank player you've ever seen. Be a scientist and run an experiment: Spend money and watch your ""winrate"" suddenly go up!  Still not convinced? Watch your favorite streamers get secret algorithm boosts from the developers so they can ""win"" but we all know if they were in the matches you face on your account, even the ""pros"" couldn't win. Doubt me? Tell me how you win when your team runs down middle and feeds as soon as they respawn because you didn't play the way ""they want"" or because they lost their last game and now you must suffer 2 or you defeated them in the previous game and now they will make sure you lose.  Let's find a solution! Simply put them on your avoid list right? But wait! You are limited on the amount of ""avoid"" slots even with the subscription service.  How about mute your team? Enjoy playing a ""team game"" requiring communication on silent mode.  How about communicate with your team? Watch them mute you faster than you can say ""Cash or Credit.""   ""Free To Play"" has and always will be a keyword for ""Pay To Win"" and ""Hackers Paradise"".  Even ""pro teams"" can't beat ""AI"" artificial intelligence.  Look up ""Open AI defeats OG"" on youtube from 6 years ago for any ""haters"" or ""doubters"" of what I'm saying. Better yet, look up ""Dota 2 Tips hackers"" and you will find a plethora of dota 2 cheats and cheaters.  For the longest time people ran with the mantle of ""hacks don't exist"" in dota or ""it's about skill"" while they ""360 headshot"" you and laugh. Anyone still remember ""Liver King Claims To Be Natty""? Or how about Clintons ""I did not sleep with that woman! Ms. Lewinski!"".  The developers don't care about any of us, simply about making money. The game was never about skill or any other ""keywords"" they use to trigger you with. It was and always will be simply a source of endless revenue for a company ""Valve"" that simply doesn't care but they can and will keep you coming back because ""things are different now"".  They know we can't stop them and they can and will continue to treat us like the cash cows we are. This game owes you nothing but they can and will steal everything from you if you let them.  When you get called an idiot in dota or any other game just take a deep breathe and imagine the anonymous idiot behind a computer screen being a keyboard warrior with his paid actor ""friends"" ganging up on you because they don't want to be the next target.  One look at your President of Valve Corporation ""Lord Gaben"" or his ""net worth"" should tell you all you need to know about ""Valve"" and their so called ""ethics"".  If you get on his nice list maybe he will even give you an ""Immortal"" high rank account for free so you 2 can look and act like a ""pro"" 2.  If you read nothing else just do this: Find a guy/girl you like and tell them how important a video game called ""Dota 2"" is to you and how much time you've ""invested"".

But here’s the catch: it’s only fun for the first 0.01% of players who have mastered every single mechanic. For everyone else, it’s a constant state of being too weak to matter or too dead to play. Matches last an average of 35–50 minutes, which sounds fine until you realize you can lose in the first five and still be forced to sit there for the rest of the match pretending you have hope.    The Learning Curve – shaped like a cliff  Most games ease you in. Dota 2 hands you a rope, tells you to climb, and then sets the rope on fire. The tutorial teaches you how to move and buy a single item — then drops you into games where you’re expected to instantly understand last-hitting, creep aggro, stacking camps, ward placement, map awareness, item timing, power spikes, counterpicks, and at least 20 hero-specific mechanics.    The Community – a global anthology of toxicity  If the United Nations wanted a case study in human hostility, Dota 2’s voice chat logs would be the first thing they open. Teammates will flame you for playing badly, for playing well, for picking the wrong hero, or for existing at all. You’ll get blamed for losses you didn’t cause and rarely thanked for wins you carried. Mute buttons exist, but that only stops the words — the ping spam will still haunt you.    Matchmaking – where dreams go to die  Valve’s matchmaker feels like it was coded by a dice-rolling raccoon. One game you’ll have coordinated teammates, the next you’ll have someone who just discovered WASD. There’s nothing like getting matched with a first-time player on Techies when you’re up against a 6,000 MMR stack.    The Meta – a constantly shifting nightmare  Every patch flips the entire game upside down. One month your favorite hero is an unstoppable powerhouse, the next they feel like a wet noodle. Learn one strategy? Too bad — it’s obsolete by the next Tuesday.    Graphics & Sound – fine, but irrelevant  Yes, the game looks good. Yes, the sound design is sharp. But when you’re on a 50-second death timer because you got one-shot by a hero you didn’t even see on your screen, you won’t care about the pretty trees or the satisfying crit sound.    The Addiction Loop – your worst habit in disguise  The most diabolical part of Dota 2 is that it keeps tricking you into coming back. You’ll swear you’re done after a soul-crushing loss, but then you think, “One more game. I can win this time.” Then it’s 3 AM, your eyes hurt, and you’ve gained nothing but a deeper sense of regret.    Conclusion – a perfectly balanced disaster  Dota 2 is a masterclass in game design and a masterclass in ruining your mood. It’s the kind of game that can give you the best match of your life and the worst match of your life in the same evening. If you value your sanity, your free time, or your blood pressure, stay away. If you do play, you’ve either accepted the suffering… or you’re too far gone to notice anymore.    Final Score: 2/10 — “Technically brilliant, emotionally bankrupt.","buruk"

"76561198062540840","This game will make you question reality. You will end up with a warped sense of time, failed subjects (if you're in school), and dead bedroom situations (if you're an alpha like me). You will lose the first game, and 10000 hours in you will continue to lose the game until you realize you are losing in life. By that time, you'll realize that you you can never quit Dota 2, cuz its the only thing you got going for you. Dota will chew you up and spit you out, when it's done with you, like the worthless dog you are.    But you get to learn Russian, Spanish, and Pinoy.    10/10 would recommend.    ","buruk"

"76561199277188980","Dota 2 is a game that feels like it's divided into two types of players:    1.Newcomers and casual players who want to have fun and enjoy the game.    2.Lifeless, robot-like individuals obsessed with winning a regular, rewardless game just to feel human for a moment.    The experience can be incredibly frustrating for those who fall into the first category, as the toxic and overly competitive atmosphere created by the second group often ruins the enjoyment.

The best thing about the game is the fact that you might get paired with a team and if you say anything they’ll just report you for comm abuse and then you can watch that communication score start dropping the report system is a joke whoever implemented it like this needs to be fired and banned from working on any games ever!  Worse than that is if you’re new to the game you play with everyone else you don’t get to play with people of your level no I’ve seen people who’ve only played 1 game paired with people who have played since launch.  The saddest part about playing with people of different skill levels is sometimes to win 1 game you might have to play 14 games that’s a joke the system for match making is broken and if you lost with someone and put that you don’t want to play with them the Dota system should pick up on that and not pair you with them for atleast the rest of the day!

Это когда ты приходишь уставший после работы, включаешь комп, заходишь в матч и через 3 минуты хочешь эмигрировать в тундру и жить среди волков, потому что там, в отличие от паблика, хотя бы никто не пикает Techies.  Игру придумали для того, чтобы проверить, насколько быстро человек может пройти стадии принятия неизбежного:  Отрицание: ""Мы можем выиграть!""  Гнев: ""КУДА ТЫ ИДЁШЬ, ЭТО НЕ ТВОЙ ЛЕЙН!""  Торг: ""Пожалуйста, давайте просто дефать трон…""  Депрессия: ""Почему я вообще это играю…""  Принятие: ""Ладно, next.""  Особенности: ✔ Ультра-токсичное комьюнити — теперь вы тоже психолог! ✔ Баланс — в этой игре нет меты, тут рулит Рандом и Чистое Безумие. ✔ Патчи выходят чаще, чем я успеваю выучить, что делает новый герой. ✔ Отношения: были. ✔ Работа: уволился. ✔ Сон: зачем он, если можно страдать?

Did not type in any of the games I have played, not even once, while having other people wishing me death, sending swastikas in chat and fully running down games. Absolute clown show, no thanks.

"76561199141868540","One of the most miserable gaming experiences after about the 25-30 minute mark, the game is full of psychos who enjoy playing 70 to 80 minute games where they will actively suicide into the enemy making your experience harder in the process.   Definitely don't play this game if you value your time because the amount of mechanics that exist just to prevent you from ending the game to queue the next one are insane, there is no surrender option and the community loves that.   They are a bunch of extremely toxic (mostly Russian) idiots who start yelling on the mic at you and that also doesn't help the fact that you have to share a team with these guys for the next potential 60 minutes of your time.   There is depth to this game, for sure, but at the same time nothing really prevents you from 5 manning everywhere in lower mmr and winning for free, at least that's my experience   Anyways don't play this stupid thing if you like being happy, because it is a sure thing that you will not be playing this, just boot up League honestly, one game lasts 15 to 20 minutes and off you go.

Sometimes I have to wait for over 100 games just to play the hero I like.  I also dislike being forced to play all roles after finishing my role queue.

"76561199261524308","I used to love this game, I've been playing since the original DOTA (on Warcraft 3 [Custom Game]). However, recently the game has become substantially worse, rife with toxic behavior from people who believe they know how to play the game, but unfortunately do not. Recently, I've had people curse me out calling me every name under the sun, simply for correcting them about a mistake they made with regards to the rules of making a report, or how the game is traditionally played. Sometimes the players will just shut down completely, (I'm being cordial and kind the entire time, mind you.) so they start talking over me every time I try to talk, not letting me get a word in edgewise. At that point I may simply call them a ""noob"" they report me and then somehow I get my behavior score lowered, even though they were the one harassing me and going utterly ballistic in the first place. I find this to be completely ridiculous. Most people cannot take constructive criticism or advice in this game, they almost ALWAYS take it personally. Also, there are some EXTREME imbalances in the game, where characters such as Warlock, Windranger, and Juggernaught can simply plow through nearly an entire team by themselves, due to their outrageously overpowered ultimate abilities. This game needs some SERIOUS reworking.  As if all of that wasn't bad enough, There is a disconnect on nearly 2/3 games now, meaning you typically have to start at least 3 different games just to get one that you may be actually be able to play through to the finish, without someone disconnecting. I've even disconnected several times myself, and I know that it's not my internet causing the issue because I haven't disconnected from the internet at all. This has become a constant. I used to be able to recommend this game, but I certainly no longer can for these reasons.","buruk"

Players should be mandated to take a communication course before being allowed to play ranked games, but instead Valve allows this toxic community to flourish and the innocent receive vindictive reports and banishment.

As much as I want to learn to play it I don't feel like spending hundreds of hours studying every hero and their abilities just to end up being deleted by a person who has played hundred times longer than you while simultaneously being told to end my days in a language I couldn't understand until starting this game. Everything is overwhelming and you don't have time to figure anything out before being thrown into a game. There doesn't seem to be a way to queue for a specific role or if there is I'm too stupid to find it so when you get in a game you have no idea which role you are expected to play while also some of the heroes not being available to you despite them being an option in ""new player mode"" (for example Muerta). There are so many features and the game is incredibly complex, but almost none of it is explained so you end up watching hours of tutorials to get the most basic grasp on it.   I prefer the overall design to LoL and would much rather play this one over it, but I feel like the only way to get into it as a new person is to have a friend who has played it for years and can teach you while playing with you.    My internet disconnected for a few seconds while playing and after rejoining the match, nothing seemed to move despite waiting for a couple of minutes. Only thing that helped was closing the entire game and restarting it to be able to join that match and afterwards I was given a punishment for ""abandoning"" the game.

"76561198035064386","As a long-time Dota 2 player since 2013, I’ve witnessed the game evolve—but not always for the better. While the core gameplay remains engaging, Valve’s approach to matchmaking and MMR has become increasingly frustrating, to the point where it feels like the system is actively working against you rather than facilitating fair competition.  -The biggest issue with Dota 2’s ranked system is its apparent forced 50% win rate mechanic. No matter how well you play, the game seems determined to keep you at a certain MMR range by stacking the odds against you, even if you’re a positive player, the game will punish you by pairing you with toxic teammates or griefers if your Behavior Score drops slightly, making climbing nearly impossible, OR  after a few wins, the system will almost always match you against significantly stronger opponents or give you weaker teammates to ""balance"" your progress.  - I mean back in the day, ranking up felt rewarding. Now, it feels like the system is deliberately slowing your progress to keep you playing longer, because of smurfs and boosters ruining games or due to role queue exploits!  - If you’ve been playing since 2013 (like me), you’ve probably noticed that Dota 2 doesn’t reward experience. Even if you take a short break, the game seems to ""forget"" your skill level, placing you in worse matches until you ""prove yourself"" again. The low to mid-tier ranks (Crusander to Legend) are where the worst matchmaking occurs—filled with boosted accounts, griefers, and players who don’t care about winning.  - So, to conclude, if you’ve been stuck in the same rank for years despite improving, it’s not (just) your fault—the system is designed this way. Dota 2’s matchmaking doesn’t prioritize fair games it prioritizes engagement, keeping you grinding endlessly. Unless Valve makes drastic changes, the cycle of frustration will continue, making the game feel more like a chore than a rewarding experience. If you’re tired of the grind, the best solution might be to step away—because Dota 2 clearly doesn’t respect your time 👿","buruk"

This cycle of alternating between favorable and frustrating matchups feels manipulative and disheartening.

This digital cesspool is a toxic wasteland where the only thing more frustrating than the gameplay is the community.    The matchmaking is a broken mess, pairing seasoned veterans with absolute noobs. It's like trying to teach a toddler how to play chess while a grandmaster watches. The heroes are so overpowered or underpowered that it feels like a rigged casino. And don't even get me started on the balance changes. They're so frequent and unpredictable that it's like trying to hit a moving target in a hurricane.    But the real horror lies in the community. Every game is a verbal battleground, filled with insults, threats, and a constant barrage of flaming. It's like being trapped in a toxic wasteland with a bunch of angry monkeys. And if you're lucky enough to escape a game without being verbally abused, you'll probably be reported for ""abandoning"" the match.    The toxicity doesn't stop at the verbal abuse. The in-game chat is filled with spam, advertising, and people trying to sell you items for real money. And if you're unlucky enough to encounter a hacker, your game is pretty much over.

"76561198856182653","[h1]Dota 2 – A Brutal Lesson in Frustration (from a LoL Veteran)[/h1]  With over 4000 hours in League of Legends, I thought I’d seen it all in the MOBA world. I expected Dota 2 to be hard, deep, maybe even rewarding in time. Instead, I found a game that actively hates new players.  [h2] Hero Design – Welcome to the Stun-Lock Hell[/h2] Dota 2 doesn’t teach you. It punishes you. • Enemies strike from fog with absurd range. • You're stunned before you see them. • You're deleted before you can blink. • There’s no counterplay, no outplay, no escape.  This isn't a learning curve – it’s a spike through your skull.  [h2] Thrown Into the Fire, Alone[/h2] I requested a coach. No one came. There’s no tutorial that actually helps. No guidance. No mentoring. You're tossed into matches with veterans who will tear you apart, and if you ask for help? Expect pings, flames, or silence.  Dota 2 doesn’t care if you’re learning. It just wants you to suffer or quit.  [h2] The Item System – Designed to Confuse, Not Enhance[/h2] • Active items with no visual clarity • Courier juggling like it’s StarCraft • Recipes that make zero sense • Mandatory outside research just to function  I spent more time alt-tabbing to Wikis than actually playing the game. At some point I asked myself: Is this even fun anymore?  [h2] Chaos Disguised as Depth[/h2] Early game? Slow and punishing. Mid game? Fog ganks and surprise deaths. Late game? Blink in, die instantly, stare at death screen.  I didn’t get better. I got numb and I couldn’t learn from my mistakes because I didn’t even understand what killed me.  It’s not ""deep gameplay."" It’s opaque and abusive game design.  [h2] Community – Gatekeeping on Steroids[/h2] • Ask a question? Get mocked. • Die once? ""Report noob."" • Try to play safe? ""Why u no help?""  This isn't a community. It's a fortress of elitism, and if you’re not already inside, you're just cannon fodder.","buruk"

The game is fun until you go in to ranked game mode.....because for 30 minutes straight you will perform for the highest level possible and the rest of your teammates will have 16 to 20 deaths and would have fed the enemy carry and already made him fat ...... and they don't have the knowledge on which hero they should pick and if you suggest them to pick a hero they will start trash talking against you......and supports will try to deward sometimes and if they fail to deward and get killed they will start feeding ..... and with all these people if you play ranked games you will get STRESS,ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.

Just played an entire day with 2 wins because my team is always filled with at least one player not even knowing the game letting alone the hero he picked or just had to play all by himself. Skill levels are heavily mis-matched except in two games and only 1 was among the ones I won. So even among 1 of the 2 games I won it was still heavily one-sided except it was my side being the unreasonably good side.  Usually when you lose a few games in a role the system will re-rate your skill and match you with easier enemies. Well, not in this game, you can have supper easy wins and losses in a role for as long as a day. I don't enjoy much after winning un-challenging games in a role for that long and certainly don't enjoy losing for that long.  DOTA2 is too broken now.","buruk"

"76561198018347508","I came back to Dota after years and I can't believe what you've done to it. I search for ranked matches in West EU. Literally in every game more than half of the players are from countries other than West EU. Everywhere is full of Russians or Ukrainians. They shout into the voice chat in their own language. They flood the chat text with meaningless characters that no one understands. There's nothing you can do about it. As soon as you politely ask these monkeys for English, that they play in Western Europe, you get even more Russian and Ukrainian as an answer. This is not fun, friends. It really is not. The only option is to mute everyone, but then I can go play any singleplayer and I'll have the same experience. I can't play on more Western servers because of the ping.  I absolutely don't understand why I can't ban heroes in ranked games. The game itself bans heroes completely randomly. What's the point of that?  There is no system in the game to give up a game you've already lost. For example, in a game where everyone is yelling at each other in Ukrainian and Russian. In a game where the pick fails and in the 10th minute the score is 0:20 and it is clear to everyone that it is a loss. In such games you make the players suffer another 20-50 minutes. For leaving earlier and saving nerves and mental health you penalize. Because you don't want the players to have fun. You want them to suffer until the last second. This is not fun, friends. It really is not.  There are many similar games like your Dota on the market. Just get inspired by others. Take the best from them. What you are missing. And for God's sake implement it.

"76561198355138547","Hello, my name is Miguel, I… I would like to expose my pain, my anguish, my despair, and above all, my years of loneliness that were falsely hidden by this curse they call a game, and that only got worse after I learned how to play Invoker. I… I deeply regret ever starting this.  The year was 2017, I was a young boy wandering and browsing the internet, I needed something to get addicted to and unfortunately, I chose this game instead of pornography or methamphetamine. You, reader, might think I’m exaggerating or using extreme situations to expose my unhappiness. But truly, honestly, maybe it would be better to be in prison right now, paying for the crime of drug use and dealing, serving my 15-year sentence and in the end… in the end, seeing the sunlight and not feeling pain, guilt, sadness, and maybe, maybe, even after all of it, a desire to feel that pain again — that pain more addictive than cocaine. Gabe Newell produced not a game, but a pact you sign, and that pact is Dota 2.  Not because it’s a bad game, not just because of that, but because it consumes you like a demon. It feeds on your pain, your sadness, your anger, and it only grows stronger. Believe me, I’m a rational guy and I’m sure there’s no explanation other than supernatural for what happens when you play this game. It’s the equivalent of shoving a pineapple into your anus and, after bleeding intensely and stabilizing, ripping it out, pouring hot oil, and then pouring alcohol on top of it all. And yet, despite everything, you still feel the urge to repeat the experience.  So yes, it was a pact. I spend my time with this game while it drains my life energy, and in return, I receive trauma, I receive emptiness. I look at the world and see how much time I’ve lost. I could have taken up gardening, learned sign language, become a bodybuilder, or even an astronaut!!! But instead, I was consumed and rotted little by little, until I finally broke free from the roots of evil, looked back at my past, and felt despair for not being able to rescue my younger self — hopeful, innocent…  If you’re reading this, no, don’t play Dota 2.

Big patches just like minor changes in map, item nerfes, new neutrals and thats all, overpowered supports, super weak core heroes, that cant solo kill in early stages, cause of more affordable saving items, lower overall dps and stun duration, more health points, more jungle camps, gold from stacks, free exp from shrines of wisdom, free wards, shards from tormentor, artifacts with enchantments and tp scrolls on death. Supports double or even tripled their net worth from the times when dota have highest online and biggest prize pool of the international, over the time game moving towards casual gameplay, over-depended on stable nervous system of your teammates, bunch of mechanics and heroes were simplified for the sake of new players, but they totally lost respect of a loyal olds.","buruk"

"76561198078744228","The game itself can be very fun. If you've got 5 friends who want to put a lot of time and energy into learning a complex and, frankly, rewarding game, I actually do recommend it. The problem is that it is a multiplayer game with a lot of complexity and a lot of different ideas on how to play, and no clear answers on how to do it right. Everyone has their own ideas, and pretty much everyone is adamant that their idea is correct. If you think the best path to winning is to group up and deathball down mid, but someone else wants to split push and play for late, then there is going to be a disagreement. Gamers, especially those who are playing an older, competetive game, are famous for their level-headedness and well spoken discussion. Except that they aren't. Nobody talks unless it is to hate each other, you will see slurs everywhere, and nobody will accept that jumping into the opposing team alone was the wrong move, so long as they made it.  There are friendly players. There are good players. There are games where both teams walk away happy.  You will not play in those games. Maybe at the start you'll have some fun ones in between getting stomped, but as you play more and end up alongside people who have forgotten that its a game and not a representation of their self-worth, the good games will become few and far between as you spend most of your time trying to not tilt your teammates. That last bit will destroy any fun you've had in the game, as every interaction, from picking a character to what item you grab, becomes a chance to light the powderkeg. Even muting people doesn't fully stop the hate.   TLDR: I love the game. I think it is one of the most fun and complex games I have ever had the pleasure of putting time into. But I have been playing it for over a decade, taken multiple breaks because of the aforementioned issues, and can only wish I could go back to not knowing anything about the game. Don't confuse your rank for your own value/self-worth, don't listen to the people who do, and be ready to mute/report, and you may have a good time with one of the best games ever made. But you'll likely just end up getting yelled at by people who have little else going on in their lives.","buruk"
"76561198091492750","This game isn’t just a disappointment — it’s a masterclass in how to turn a great game into a hollow and utterly joyless time sink. What you’ll encounter isn’t a polished but a decrepit platform weighed down by technical failures and blatant disregard for players’ time.  Performance and Menus: From the very moment you launch the game, you’re punished with sluggish menus that are overloaded with pointless clutter.  The menu UI is giving the illusion that the game is still actively developed, but in reality, there is essentially zero technical support and almost no meaningful improvements being made. The servers themselves are a disaster - frequent desynchronizations often result in players being falsely accused of abandoning matches, a problem that has persisted for years without remedy.  Server capacity is insufficient, and there is obviously no interest in fixing the backbone of the game.  Matchmaking – The Absolute Low Point: If there’s a single reason to avoid Dota 2 altogether, it’s the matchmaking system.  It is just rigged, unbalanced, and  unfair. The game regularly throws smurfs and new players together.  The ranking system itself is designed around an artificial 50% win rate, with wins and losses being the sole determinants of MMR.  This means you’re not rewarded for general performance, teamwork, or improvements.  Balanced, competitive matches are essentially mythical — you’ll be lucky to find one challenging, fun game out of twenty - don't go down that hole just to chase this experience. The end result is a game that feels less like entertainment and more like a psychological trap.  You’re lured into chasing the rare “worthy” match, but those moments are so vanishingly scarce that they only highlight how broken the rest of the experience is.  Dota 2 is dead.  What remains is a soulless husk dressed up with meaningless cosmetics and superficial updates.  It wastes your time, it disrespects your effort, and it offers nothing in return but frustration.  There are far better ways to spend your time than on a heartless, decaying game like this.","buruk"

"76561198007610291","Dota is still the same game it became many years ago: retard accommodation concept to make profit.  If you play well and too much beyond casual (ie. sunday only players) the game will offset high numerical players with low-numerical ones to 'balance teams.'     The problem arises when it doesn't care for who on what role. When you your p1-2 is a fraud and they're compensated with better p3-5, you will never finish games - as certain roles are more significant than others for winning the game.     This observable through several things:  1. metrics of all players during laning (@10:00min mark) - signaling of skill/ before any interference of other players  2. When you receive 'inverse pie-chart' from ranked roles performances: when you played one role and scored better in all other roles: the game will now believe you offset numerically inferior players and puts you such teams*.  3. the blunt share of disconnecters will be on your team. This is because they are literally afk and thus have lower stats than everyone else, even if the enemy team potentially 5 slots for disconnecters (assuming you never dc yourself).   4. the 'dota 2 rejects' (whom are avoided for being low-metric players throught dotaplus) will always be on your team. Including account buyers and boosted players.  5. You will always be on teams that have support players mid, support offlaner and notoriously double p5, and very soft carries/ midlaners on safelane - usually against fully-fledged teams.    There is no escaping it, unless you take a long break and re-qualify for casual/ welcome back experience.  The entirety of dota 2 matchmaking is fake: dota tracks your likeliness to commit to the game in every single way: and will only drizzle good matches every now and then followed by completely moronic experiences (Valve would like to accommodate everyone including account buyers).  - the length of your game session on each day.  - your willingness to play after a stomp or loss/ how many such games it can give you before you call quit.  - your silence when you have completely mouth-breathing account buyers on your team/ your acceptance of hosting enjoyable experiences for fraudsters (which is why having peak behaviour-score is an actual worse experience than being slightly below).  - If you are on retarded teams, you will naturally end up scoring numerically (even more) relatively better -> which will put on further retarded teams: like a death-spiral. this when you should take a break.    Yes, you can get so much skill that you can literally can carry/ win games with 1-3 account buyers on your team, but it will never be a pleasant experience. This is why most games are extremely stompy/ one-sided these days. Someone has to play with the bad players, and it'll be players who play much.      *this is why should semi-afk when you start losing, sell items and zone-out to lose to quickly, as it neatly lowers your stats. This indeed very toxic and ruins potentially turn-around matches, but you just have to join in on it. If you tryhard, you will just perform even more relatively better than players who do that, and now you'll be offset further on your next matches.      The game is not very refined on how it tracks stats, it just does for the sake of matchmaking.    ","buruk"

"76561198843180031","Is Dota a good game? Potentially yes, it seems fun, well crafted... but there are glaring issues. You have created a system where there is an elitist group of players in every match that will simply beat less experienced players, and putting BRAND new players into those lobbies. Most other games of this genre and generally for every game, will not in fact put BRAND new players against players with 4k+ matches played? There is a clear disadvantage there, even if you play all the tutorial and try AI games. Language and terms are not matched, knowledge of items and the game not there.   Why in the world is this game so beloved? Because the past generation continues to play and upkeeps it, but it is awful. The community is unhelpful and toxic, not in the sense of slurs or insults but rather that they are so unwilling to help and simply flame new players and then make fun of their mistakes instead of doing ANYTHING useful. Whilst not outwardly toxic, this is one of the least fun, most dislikeable communities I've ever seen.

"76561199817761730","Доброго времени суток уважаемые игроки Dota 2. Нет желания кому-то доказывать, или оправдывать чье-либо мнение. Комментарий сугубо больше для себя для закрепления опыта в данной сфере. В игре будучи с 2025 года и 15 января, я наиграла более 1000 матчей, подняв 1700+ ммр в рейтинге (большая часть в Allpick). За все это время в доте можно ощутить и увидеть весь спектр эмоций, большая часть из которых негативная. Придя сюда увлеченной игрой с человеком и после игры без него, дота не принесла ничего кроме негативных и пустых эмоций. Игра пустая с однообразным геймплеем и тратой времени более чем на час, а бывало и полтора. Ради чего? Ради 25 ПТС. В доте я была активным и достаточно порядочным игроком чтобы оставаться в тени наблюдателем. Люди последними грязными словами кроют в этой игре, желают смерти, кидают угрозы. Те кто имеет другой ранг дабы самоутвердиться готовы низко пасть чтобы удовлетворить свою неполноценность. Люди растеряли свою честь в компьютерной игре, и с пенной у рта готовы грызть друг друга. И вся дота как посев надежды, лотерея. Большая часть игроков никогда не станет известными или не будет участвовать в больших играх, фигурируя как известные крутые команды и тп, они застрянут на своем рейтинге 2к и не сдвинутся. Для игроков это не просто уже способ побега от реальности, а способ укрыться и скоротать время. Но годы идут, мы взрослеем и отдаем лучшие годы впустую. Можно вставить 5 копеек и сказать - Не все такие! Я играю в меру!. Конечно! Мера - есть, но не все ее соблюдают.   Я не рекомендую сюда заходить игрокам которых интересует нормальный геймплей, сугубо сосредоточенный на игре, а не на личностях что смеют оскорблять, ведь даже если таким людям дать ответ они его не поймут. Другой сорт. Моей руки больше в игре этой не будет. Удачи людям в игровом мире. Игры приносят пользу, и иногда даже помогают, но они также могут нанести и вред, если ты далеко в них заходишь.","buruk"

However, this means that it is even more important to communicate with people who just do not want to. Ultimately, Dota 2 is ruined by a complete disconnect between the game mechanics and the community it  spawned.     This is a frustration and grief simulator with only one promise: it will waste your time.    Don't pick up this game in 2025 or beyond - it's not worth it.","buruk"

"76561198042292732","I've played dota on and off for almost 20 years. In my opinion it is the greatest game of all time. Over the years there has been few things in my life that itch like dota. Waking up and just knowing i needed to play a pudge game or storm. The frontier patch was the bell heralding the end of my dota journey. I want to say thanks for everyone who worked on dota and brought it to the world.   I used to believe dota was a skillset. something I could build and use throughout my life. The energy to get better. The time invested reading patch notes and experimenting with mechanics. Learning each and every crevice of the map so i could juke or make a play wherever i was. As I get older, Dota gets faster. what used to be a real time strategy game seems to be moving more to a league of legends type of game. Having a great mind for dota has never been less valuable. As a low immortal I was around 400 wins averaging 25 mmr per win from the top end of immortal. If I could maintain a 60% winrate it would take me 2000 games to reach 15k mmr. in the time it would take to play those games the game will change drastically likely multiple times. New cracked op heroes will dominate the meta for months at a time. The game will get faster,   and my 20 years experience will become irrelevant, or worse detrimental.   Dota wasnt a game that needed *fixing*. I understand that popularity is the only metric most game designers care about now a days. But it was a deeply flawed concept that you could simply mirror league of legends design philosophy having rotations of heroes being OP instead of aiming for balance. Dota shouldnt be an APM check either. it should be strategy and execution.    If Dota was slower (Lower the amount of things you can accomplish in 60 seconds). If I didnt have to worry about the next frontier patch. If Dota was being designed for balance. If New heroes were designed as less is more. If the game design philosophy of league and fortnite had never taken root in Dota. I would still be playing. And I could recommend this game to other players.  Dota with its current team of no doubt all star industry game designers perhaps might bring Dota into a new golden age of popularity. But I will sadly not being playing. Everytime I get the itch to play dota. I remember that dota 2 really just doesnt scratch the itch anymore..","buruk"

It completely kills my motivation to play with problems like this.

"76561199109036512","There are three major issues with this game: - Is extremely unintuitive - Relies too much on stun mechanics - Punishes newer players... hard     For some reason, the tutorial system is very unhelpful. The first 8 tutorials seem fine and dandy, but after that, every tutorial either crashes your game, is extremely difficult, or is just not functional. When you enter a game, you are given a selection of a very generous amount of heroes, each of which have 2 or 3 ability changes which serve to further change the match up to some degree, which is fine unless you have only around 30 seconds to select from them in a match. You could somewhat circumvent this by testing each hero in a single player environment, but this shows not a whole lot about your match ups against other heroes or multiple heroes or which heroes to pick to have best effect with.    When you get into a fight, you'll notice a pattern, start by killing the creeps, then charge at the enemy heroes with a three second long stun, then shred their health pool before they have a chance of doing anything about it. If you are landed in this situation, you have three options, run... and die, fight back... and die, or stun them back... and still die except you dealt some damage. This system relies too much on stuns, its even worse if your teammate happens to surround you in trees... for some reason. that also works to just kill you, and even worse, you might have lived if your teammate had helped to get the enemies off of you.    When you join a match.. everyone is relatively evenly matched, until someone gets one kill, levels up and unlocks a 3 second stun, which snowballs into the entire enemy team being twice the level of even your highest teammate, so having one teammate that's newer to the system just leads to having every enemy be twice as strong. So basically securing first blood usually means your team just... wins... for free... and there isn't much the enemy team can do about it, except keep feeding you levels.","buruk"

"76561198066400677","I would like to say that though the game is probably one of the most unique games of all time, I cannot recommend it in its current state. I think that the gameplay, phases of the game and all the heros uniqueness is what makes it one of the best games of all time.  I cant reccomend the current map state. The whole point of DOTA is to make it so that its a multiplayer online battle arena which in turn means you fight for victory via strategy, positioning and timing.   As the map has become 20% - 30% bigger, it adds more jungle camps within the game which is a bad thing. The jungle mechanic is supposed to be a downtime during the very early stages of the game and not during the mid or late game. Because you add jungle camps on the outskirts of the map, it creates where both teams just AFK farm for 30 minutes and try to scale even though if you are in an advantageous position. You cannot rally to create a smoke gank, you cannot ward because you would be alone and even if you did get a ward off, the chances you kill someone is really low because you have your team still farming the outskirts of the map.  Because of these changes, the skill level has drastically became lower for players especially their awareness of the game state. You have people barely even ganking the lanes and for people that even want to gank, you have players ignore your pings about you coming to gank and they just afk farm while you die all because of these jungle camps. It makes them less aware about the game state and just makes them go into a monochrome state where ""i am not ready to fight unless im 6 slotted"" and even then, they are sometimes useless with a 6 slot state.  Check my wraith king teammate, he had no presence whatsoever because he was always getting kited, nice item choice retard.  You have added point of interests such as the lotus area, the exp gathering area and the tormentor however they are never even contested most of the time (besides the lotus area in the early game I guess but that dies really fast). They see it as a detriment to go to that far just because they would rather go to a jungle camp and contest something that can give them even a bigger boost to fight. The tormentor has never ever been touched in japan server (and yes i know japan has all the russian rejects that dont play the game properly but that doesnt change the state it should be in) and i think that it should be changed so that it goes to where the sanctuary is.  The most fun patch was probably the updates when they had the shrines but I think with their positioning of the shrines, it made it a power spot to have turn potential. I think if you add shrines back into the game it should be next to tier two towers. This way it punishes the mid if they just use it for farm and not harassing their lane and you also enforce a retreat timing for people that have ganked but can return to the field of battle fast but not too fast to the point where it was too OP.  I think if you enjoy constant fights, you should not play this game right now. They have a lot to work on when it comes to the game especially with all of the russian reject cykas coming to japan server and ruining my game experience. Keep in mind i still get good Russian players that are constantly aggressive and I commend them, but i would say 70% are russian rejects that never played DOTA before source 2.  Drow players think they are good, anti mage players think they are good. All you did was AFK farm and you won the game. It shouldnt be this way. Fuck you drow players especially, you dont play the game properly at all you fucking retards.

"76561198867267251","The game changed so much after the  ""The New Journey"" [7.00] update. I tried to adapt but just couldn’t. One of my biggest gripes is how the developers made matches longer. Games used to last 25–40 minutes, but after this update, I was stuck in 60+ minute sessions. That’s just too much time, man.  There was also a clear shift toward forced teamplay instead of personal skill. Heroes became way tankier and harder to kill, and the introduction of new support items like aeon disk and rain drops just broke the game, in my opinion. The ban phase in ranked All Pick feels stupid, and the glyph refresh after the first set of towers falls into the same category. Dota just doesn’t feel like the old days anymore, when individual plays had a huge impact.  Moreover, the dark fantasy style got replaced by cringy emotes and cosmetics. Some Arcana items aren’t even available on the market anymore because they’re locked behind Battle Passes.  At this point, Dota 2 just isn’t the game I fell in love with. ","buruk"

There's no good balacing of the teams, it can happend that you lose like 20 matches in a row because the algorithm puts you with the beginners or griefers and even though you can play pretty good, you still lose MMR (there's no AI involved into calculating your real contribution to the team and thus reward you with less MMR loss, for example).

"76561198136634919","Oh boy, where do I even begin? They ruined Techies. Absolutely gutted him. Once the most chaotic, creative, and downright unhinged hero in Dota 2, Techies used to be the embodiment of psychological warfare. A hero that didn’t just play the game—he reshaped it. You didn’t just lane against Techies you lived in fear of him. Every step outside your base was a gamble. Every jungle path, every rune check, every high ground push—a potential death sentence. And that was the beauty of it.    Techies wasn’t just about kills. He was about map control, area denial, vision, tempo disruption, and yes, burst damage that could delete a carry before they even realized they were in danger. He was a puzzle the enemy team had to solve every game. Do we buy detection? Do we send the support to face-check? Do we delay our push because we know there’s a minefield waiting? He forced you to think differently.    And now? Now he’s just... a stun bot with a grenade and a sad little zap. They turned a hero that used to be a walking trap card into a glorified ranged initiator. Sure, he’s more “teamfight viable” now, but at what cost? They stripped away the soul of the hero. The mad genius who could single-handedly stall a game for 20 minutes, who could turn a lost match into a win with one perfectly timed suicide and a mine stack in the trees.    People used to hate Techies, and that was the point. He was supposed to be annoying. He was supposed to be different. He was the anti-meta, the chaos factor, the wildcard. And now he’s just... another cog in the machine. Another hero with a cookie-cutter build and a predictable playstyle.    I miss the old Techies. The one who made you paranoid. The one who made you laugh maniacally when a triple kill popped up from a minefield you planted 10 minutes ago. The one who made you feel something—rage, joy, fear, awe. Now? He just makes me feel... disappointed.","buruk"

"76561198822333430","I’d like to sincerely request a review regarding my recent placement into Low Priority (LP). The incident happened during a Turbo match, which I was playing casually with my friends. Unfortunately, due to a sudden power outage caused by rain, I got disconnected and was unable to reconnect in time.  What’s particularly disheartening is receiving LP for a Turbo game—a mode that’s meant for quick, casual fun. I wasn’t trying to ruin anyone’s experience, and you can check that I was partying with friends. Getting LP for this completely takes away the fun, especially since it’s almost impossible to find LP matches, and no one wants to queue with you to clear them.  I understand if this system applies to Ranked or Competitive matches, but Turbo should be more forgiving. This experience honestly made me uninstall the game, despite the many hours I’ve spent enjoying Dota 2 over the years.  Please consider reviewing this case and the broader LP rules for Turbo matches. Casual players shouldn't be punished so severely for unintentional disconnects in non-competitive modes.","buruk"

"76561198002156890","TL:DR The actual gameplay is top-tier MOBA and valve made a solid attempt to make playing/learning the genre reasonable, but the community is rancid and multiplayer is entirely the point.  Its always odd to say you recommend the game *itself* but can't recommend playing it with other human beings, especially when the game is specifically multiplayer focused. Its very well put together: I enjoy the visuals, VA, character designs and mechanics (even if I find the shop's added complexity a little much for an already high skill ceiling game). But its a MOBA, you have to play it with others, and a good chunk of the time if you don't have a regular gaming group of friends to call upon, it is abuse and toxicity of the highest order.  It'd be one thing to spend your limited time on this earth playing a game with some of the most unpleasant people I've had the misfortune of meeting, it's entirely another to be locked in with them for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour. Its possible to be held hostage by team-mates who refuse to play communally or admit defeat when it's obvious. Its possible that your own poor play ruins the game for everyone else on your team early on, with little means to claw back the difference. It is an unforgiving game to learn and more punishment than play in all regards.  I don't know if its just part and parcel of the genre forever after now -like how if you play any given FPS multiplayer long enough you'll have a 12 year old claim copulation with your mother- but LoL and DOTA2 have killed my interest in the genre forever. If I see MOBA as a tag on a new game, I steer very clear.   If you have remarkably thick skin, an organised consistent group of friends to play with/against or just adore the genre despite its community failings, go right ahead. DOTA 2 is a good game that's terrible to play.","buruk"

I feel like the game is catering to the high end players, as that is their source of income. The communities are toxic, games you are losing get dragged out so long because the winners want to pre-long the feeling of winning, meaning 50% of games are just painful as a game could be lost, but will still drag on for another 25 minutes. Years in and no surrender mechanic to deal with this, so you get locked into suffering. Its hard to push and win with your own team because everyone else wants to drag the game out, so if you try to end the game on your own, your own team flames at you. Its just toxic. I played this game for such a long time, but I only ever play with bots with one of my friends. But the bots dont get updated at all.

It will result in you getting your a** clapped by some 2000+ matches nolifers. THAT will be your only experience. I've played 4 matches now and I never managed to have a good time, not even a bit. Valve somehow is the WORST at creating unranked and ranked experiences with every game they release. This game sadly is one of the cases where its even worse than I had imagined.  In CS2 you have to get level 3 or smth to play ranked. That takes smth like 2h of casual or deathmatch or whatever. Not enjoyable but not too bothersome. Now imagine the same thing but you are basically forced to play what essentially is the ranked experience, just without a rank. Versus people that have spent THOUSANDS of hours with the game already. Considering you need to gotta play 100h that is roughly 100-140 matches. How does ANYONE at Valve think that playing that amount of matches versus people that will ALWAYS wipe the floor with you is desirable.  There IS a ""beginner mode"" (which i ALWAYS dominated without any issues, and no prior MOBA experience), however that mode does NOT count towards the 100h goal even tho it essentially IS casual (just without the ""you get your a** clapped aspect, as everyone is a newb).

You have more freedom and room for player skill expression than any other game in the market, more options for strange niche builds that still manage to work.  Unfortunately, it doesn't matter, because the game is crippled by its own matchmaking system. Matchmaking will attempt, very poorly, to make sure you have a roughly 50/50 win/loss rate. This means that you are effectively punished for having good matches, because they absolutely guarantee that within your next few games, you will find that Valve has gifted Steam accounts to uncontacted tribesmen from the depths of the Amazon, and they will astound you by playing videogames so poorly that it's no wonder they never advanced beyond living in huts.   On top of that, the entire normals pool can have brand new players. That causes two problems. One, new players are not matched with other new players, they're just mixed in at random, and good luck to you Johnny Newbie when you go against a six thousand hour player. Two, there is zero smurf detection, and smurfing is absolutely rampant to the point where it's likely that well over half of any ""new"" accounts are actually just some several-thousand-hour player exploiting matchmaking or farming the account up to sell it.  I wish I could recommend the game. I can't. It's a great game absolutely ruined by matchmaking and there is zero chance it ever gets fixed.","buruk"
"76561198988011766","[h1]Dota 2: A Subversive Critique of Imperialism and a Defense of Tradition[/h1] Dota 2, at first glance, appears to be just another competitive multiplayer game. But beneath its surface, it carries subtle—and sometimes overt—critiques of Western hegemony, while promoting a worldview that values tradition, faith, and non-Western perspectives. Unlike many games that uncritically glorify empire (such as Civilization or Call of Duty), Dota 2 presents a world where power is decentralized, where heroes from diverse cultures resist domination.  [h2]1. A Rejection of American Imperialism[/h2] The game’s lore features constant wars between ancient forces (the Radiant and the Dire), but unlike real-world conflicts driven by Western expansionism, these battles are cyclical, with no clear ""good vs. evil"" binary. Many heroes are former rulers or warriors who have lost their kingdoms—echoing the real-world consequences of colonialism.  Heroes like Vengeful Spirit and Terrorblade embody the consequences of betrayal and fallen empires, mirroring nations destabilized by foreign intervention.  Invoker, a supremely arrogant mage, represents the dangers of unchecked intellectual elitism—a critique of Western ""enlightened"" imperialism that imposes its will on others.  The Ancients themselves are cosmic forces locked in eternal struggle, suggesting that no empire (not even America’s) is destined to last forever.  [h2]2. A Non-Western Perspective on Power[/h2] Most mainstream games are told from a Eurocentric or American viewpoint, but Dota 2 includes heroes inspired by Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Slavic cultures:  Phantom Assassin (based on Persian lore) operates on a code of honor outside Western morality.  Ember Spirit and Storm Spirit draw from East Asian philosophies, rejecting rigid good/evil dichotomies.  Ogre Magi and Witch Doctor represent folk traditions often dismissed as ""primitive"" by colonial mindsets.  Even the game’s aesthetic—with its mix of Gothic, Islamic, and Eastern architecture—refuses to center the West as the default setting.  [h1] 3. Downsides of Dota [/h1]  The playerbase has an IQ that is just a few standard deviations short of the global average.  Final score: 1/10","buruk"

Trying to learn the game will just involve you getting stomped every single game since the matchmaking sucks due to there being very few new players. Starting out at least, every game is just a 40 minute slog where one team stomps the other because of matchmaking. People will reccommend you do swift play but eventually youll switch to unranked norms and have this experience for at least 50-100 games. For reference just getting 50 30 min games under your belt will take you about 1500 hours and most likely you still wont be good or even decent according to most. The game's just too old for a new player to come in and compete with the players that have thousands or tens of thousands of hours  Also the community will not support you.

"76561198013512667","The fundamental issue with Dota 2, in a sentence, is that it is a highly advanced team game. It is one the best, actually, and for most people, that's going to cause you a lot of heartache before you can reach ""The true game"". The journey, I think, isn't worth your anger or frustration.  Allow me to be clear: I have had extensive fun playing Dota 2. A lot of fun, actually. It is one of the most competitive, interesting, and nuanced team games that you can possibly play. However, to be brief, getting to the point where you can actively have fun in that kind of competitive, nuanced, and interesting environment with strategies, theorycrafting, and novel ideas takes a lot of time and effort.  The game requires a certain buy-in for the average person to play at the sufficient levels in which mastery of the game and true team-based dynamics can come into play. For me, I have not played the game solo in years. If you have a friend group that is dedicated to it but are new, I sincerely hope they are good teachers. Most people simply are not. The average person is going to have to play hundreds of hours to catch up to those friends, many of them likely solo, because playing alongside more advanced players often ruins the matchmaking and can give you bad experiences. All of these things are steps that you have to undergo to get better at the game and eventually reach the thing you initially installed for in the first place. Along this journey, you will encounter very stupid things, you will encounter frustrations, toxicity, or other random problems which are, of course, always going to be there a little bit, but are exacerbated at the level that most new players play at.   This game is magical. Extremely fun, and extremely interesting. For the most part, though, for a solo experience or a team experience, the extreme fun has a 300 hour buy-in. There will be fun to be had at lower levels, but it will come fewer and father between, and is more than most people can tolerate. This game is free, but it will cost you your time. For most people, I cannot possibly recommend that kind of cost.","buruk"

"76561198040568419","Dota 2 used to be a pretty good game. But every update, the game gets more and more one sided, and yet the games still take just as long. It's become a massive waste of time. The matchmaking is, without a doubt, the worst I've ever seen in a game, which is impressive considering the long queue times. I just played a match that was clearly over in draft, and despite the enemy team having over 4 times our kills, their support being 7 levels higher than our team, and our team basically not playing, it still took over 35 minutes for the match to end.   That may sound like bad luck, but the truth is that's every match of Dota 2 now. Heroes are so overturned that there's no build variety. There's only 2 build types, the right way and the wrong way, so game after game you see the exact same items in the exact same order. Because of how heroes counter each other, many heroes are useless in 90+% of matchups, and require hyper specific playstyle to be useful at all. Supports (most of them) get the short end of the stick. I don't know why they hate CM so much, but she gets nerfed every patch despite hardly anyone playing her. Already OP heroes will get buffs for seemingly no reason, and this just results in the same group of 20 heroes being constantly played in matches that are clearly over at the hero selection screen.  Dota's best days are long, long behind, and it's not worth picking up for anyone.","buruk"

"76561199148949921","I have like 1k hours on league. In Dota there are much more mechanics witch is crazy couse lol is one of the hardest games oat. The graphics are worse and less friendly to your eye. Obviously league was based of this game but the league gameplay is much better.","buruk"

"76561198157693954","This game is filled with nonsense interactions gameplay wise like pushing someone out of the teleportation circle not stopping teleportation. The game is also filled with a nonsense time out system where if you decline to join queue you get banned for 15 minutes and if you take too long to decide on your character it auto disconnects you from the game and gives you an hour long time out, even if you're last pick and you have 400 gold left and there is no indication you are gonna get disconnected but you still get the timeout. Also 99% of skins suck. LOL is better.","buruk"

"76561199656714951","this game is really balance and wonderful i was playing this game since forever because dota was fist  map that i tried in first game that i played (Warcraft 3) but matchmaking system is terrible, full of smurf, troll, account seller bots and toxic people so i don't recommend it not because it is bad game but because matchmaking system is worst in all moba games","buruk"

"76561198400689658","Matchmaking wait times are horrendously long even at peak hours (5-10 minutes even without low-priority) and once you get yourself put into low priority (God forbid you have to leave a few games due to either connection issues or IRL stuff popping up) it's literally unplayable. 20+ minutes just sitting around and never getting into a game isn't fun.","buruk"
"76561199205540850","I've been playing this game for a while now and I seem to noticed that DOTA2 matchmaking is the worse. After getting win streak, they'll match you with players who sucks so bad at playing and you'll keep getting the same kind of teammates after a few more games. I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this game to a GOOD HUMAN BEING due to the excessive toxicity of this game. I think DOTA2 put this algorithm so that players who are on losing streak will crave for a win and will keep playing. Hence, players will keep playing for hundreds of hours and getting addicted.","buruk"
