"76561198058437603","If you've ever wanted to age 40 years in a weekend, cry in three different emotional languages, and question your life choices every 15 minutes, congratulations — Dota 2 is your soulmate and your captor.    The game is ""free to play,"" which is ironic, because you pay with your soul. The tutorial tells you it's a strategy game, but what it fails to mention is that your biggest opponent is your own teammates. Playing Dota is like being in a hostage situation where you're also one of the kidnappers.    The matchmaking system is powered by an advanced AI that matches you with people who have either just installed the game, or just escaped a mental institution. Sometimes both. Balance? Oh, you mean the illusion of hope?    You'll find yourself saying things like:    “Why is Techies in my game again?”    “Why is the support farming mid?”    “Why am I still playing this?”    Each match starts with optimism and ends with depression, kind of like birthdays after you turn 30.    Let’s talk about toxicity. Dota 2 doesn’t have toxic players. No, that would be too simple. It has biohazard waste in voice chat. The kind of people who will ping your death three times, call you slurs in three languages, then proceed to die alone in the forest for 40 minutes.    The worst part? You’ll love it. Because winning in Dota 2 is like finding meaning in your life — rare, euphoric, and followed by a crushing loss that resets you back to reality.    In summary:  Dota 2 is the best worst thing to ever happen to me. It’s like Stockholm Syndrome with patch notes. 10/10 would uninstall and reinstall again out of pure spite.","baik"

They told me that my dad wasn't really my dad, and my mom wasn't working where I thought she was.  Also, one of the advantages is that there are many doctors playing Dota 2 and they can easily diagnose your mental and physical abilities.","baik"
"76561199528783285","Отличная игра в которой тебе всё расскажут и даже не только про игру! Ты узнаешь о необычных работах своих родственников, о том насколько много людей любит и обожает твою маму. Также один из плюсов это большой выбор героев с не сложным управлением. Например Invoker очень легкий персонаж с кучей урона подходящий для поднятия рейтинга. Комьюнити очень хорошее, иногда встречаются игроки которые настолько хорошо играют, что ломают все свои вещи и собирают новые так как хотят дать фору врагам. Также разработчики очень усердно работают над обновлениями которые выходят раз в полгода и выпускаются для того чтобы онлайн повысился с 10 человек до 11 ( при этом в игру зашел сам разработчик). Ну в целом плюсы перечислять можно долго, а вот насчет минусов, их нет. Спасибо за внимание, надеюсь этот отзыв поможет читающим!","baik"
"76561198930930471","I installed Dota 2 thinking it was a game. It’s not. It’s a federally approved psychological warfare simulator disguised as entertainment. My first match lasted 72 emotional years. Somewhere between getting flamed for buying boots and being called a “walking ward,” I felt my hair detach from my soul and leave my scalp. By the 30-minute mark, I had gray strands, hand tremors, and a newfound respect for war veterans. My carry told me to uninstall, my support told me to die, and the enemy Sniper shot me from another dimension just to remind me I was never safe. When it was finally over, I just sat there in silence, staring into the void, wondering if I’d ever feel joy again. 11/10, would suffer again.","baik"
"76561198984597300","[b]I’m writing this review instead of clicking the 'Find Match' button, which probably tells you all you need to know about the current state of my mental health. I have nearly 2,000 hours in this game, and I've somehow spent 66 of those hours in the last two weeks alone. I don’t play Dota 2 because it’s fun I play it because it's a crippling addiction disguised as a highly complex and deeply rewarding video game.  The complexity is the main selling point and the main reason you'll hate your life. This isn't a game you can just pick up. The tutorial is basically just a gentle suggestion to prepare for a lifetime of disappointment. You'll spend your first 100 hours thinking you're getting good, your next 500 realizing you know nothing, and the following 1,400 hours trying to convince your teammates to buy a simple Town Portal Scroll. Seriously, I could write an entire thesis on the existential dread that comes with seeing a key item on the ground for 15 minutes while your carry walks past it.  Despite all the soul-crcrushing toxicity, the constant balance changes, and the feeling that every loss is personally your fault, there is no greater rush in gaming than successfully executing a complicated team-fight play, especially when you are playing a hero nobody expected to work. It’s a beautifully designed, competitive, constantly evolving monster that will steal your time, ruin your sleep schedule, and give you high blood pressure. But hey, it's free, and all 120+ heroes are available right from the start, so at least your financial advisor can't complain. Just do yourself a favor: mute all chat and try to remember to blink before you're stunned.[/b]","baik"
"76561198106503136","I only played this because League of Legends put me in timeout for telling a 13-year-old jungler to uninstall their soul.    Let me set the scene: it was a dark, shameful day. Riot Games had finally pulled the plug on my main account after a small misunderstanding involving ten ping spams, three racial slurs (none mine!), and one elo-defining loss. So what did I do? Reflect? Seek therapy? Touch grass?    No. I rebounded hard—straight into the open, masochistic arms of Dota 2.    And let me tell you: it was like crawling out of a frat house fight pit and stumbling into a sadistic chess tournament being played by Russian AIs with gambling addictions. This isn’t a game. It’s a graduate-level course in suffering, delivered exclusively through slurs, spreadsheets, and a mini-map that actively gaslights you.    You think League is toxic? Dota 2 players don’t flame you—they curse your bloodline. A Peruvian witch doctor once told me to feed my courier to Roshan and then die in real life. I didn’t even know what a courier was yet. Beautiful.    The learning curve? Imagine climbing Mount Everest, but it's vertical, on fire, and halfway up someone throws a techies minefield at your crotch. Every character has 42 active abilities, a secret satanic pact, and a passive-aggressive Reddit community explaining why you're doing it all wrong. There’s no “meta”—there’s only pain, and ten dudes yelling in five languages about “item timings” while your tower disintegrates like your self-esteem.    But oh, the complexity. The strategy. The high you get from landing a five-man black hole or denying a creep like a smug little Victorian landlord. I once got a triple kill with a flaming horseman while being coached mid-game by a Russian with a drinking problem and a heart of gold. It was the most bonding I’ve experienced since my parents’ divorce.    And the graphics? It looks like a Warhammer figurine collection got possessed by Satan and reanimated using Valve’s leftover Half-Life particles. Every match feels like a beautiful fever dream inside a burning cathedral.    Final Thoughts:  Dota 2 is the game you play when you’ve hit rock bottom in League and decided to dig deeper. It doesn’t hold your hand. It rips your hand off, feeds it to a jungle creep, and then blames you for feeding. It’s brutal, exhilarating, and almost certainly responsible for 12% of global blood pressure medication sales.    I came here because I was banned.  I stayed because the voices in my head said ""GLHF.""    10/10. Would flame myself again.","baik"
"76561198080449788","Dota 2 is like a toxic relationship—you hate it, you love it, you can’t quit it. One minute you’re outplaying opponents like a grandmaster, the next you’re getting flamed by a 12-year-old playing Techies. The learning curve? More like a learning cliff. But once you get hooked, there’s no escape.  The gameplay is deep, the heroes are diverse, and every match feels like a new disaster (or masterpiece). Just remember: if you win, it’s all skill. If you lose? Obviously, your team’s fault.  10/10 – Would feed mid again.","baik"
"76561198851298885","There is nothing tidy about a great Dota match. It’s a plan written in pencil while the table shakes. You queue for one game before bed and somehow you’re counting Roshan minutes at two in the morning, telling yourself that one good smoke can still turn it.  My favorite memory isn’t a rampage or a rapier flip. It’s the quiet after we botched a mid fight, when our offlaner typed “my bad,” pinged a smoke, and cut through the triangle without another word. We wrapped around, took vision, found a single pick, and the whole map felt different. That’s the Dota I love: it breaks you down and then hands you the tools to rebuild if you keep your head.  The design feels honest in a way competitive games rarely do. Every advantage has a window you can actually spot. Every mistake leaves a footprint you can learn from. Neutral items nudge priorities without erasing identity. Buybacks are terrifying, but they are fair, and they create the best late game tension I’ve ever felt. Patches don’t delete your knowledge they make it evolve.  If you’re new and looking over the wall, you don’t need to know everything. Learn what vision does to a fight. Learn when a smoke is worth more than a stack. Mute fast when you need to. Pick a couple of heroes that make you curious and repeat them until your hands know what your eyes want. One day you’ll pull the wave to reset equilibrium without thinking, and that tiny habit will feel better than any big number on a scoreboard.  To everyone at Valve, from artists to analysts to the people keeping servers breathing on patch night, thank you for treating a free game like a craft project. Dota still feels handcrafted even when it’s loud and messy. Replays, silhouettes you recognize at a glance, the quiet relief of a clean load-in, it all adds up. If there’s one wish, it’s this: keep investing in the first ten hours so more players hit that “I get it now” moment sooner, because once it lands, they aren’t leaving.  I recommend Dota 2 without hesitation. Not because it’s easy, but because it respects the time you give it. It will frustrate you, it will humble you, and then it will hand you a win that sends you to bed smiling at the ceiling. See you at nightfall, smoke ready, buybacks aligned, one good call away from a story worth telling.","baik"
"76561198075454868","Dota 2, not a bad thing I can say about the game itself. I have spent thousands of hours, played approximately 7000 games, grinded to Immortal (highest possible medal) in ranked and finally got there after 10 years of playing but it has been a rollercoaster. The game itself is well optimised, no 2 games are exactly the same, it's a fantastic game to play with friends if you can fill a party and you can be as creative as you like with how you play a lot of heroes that the game has to offer.  I feel like if you are reading this, you have probably seen so many reviews telling you not to play because of the community, and that can't be ignored. I totally agree with the other reviews saying how bad the player base is. Ultimately, although a competitive game is usually a lot more fun when you are winning, you can't play a game that you are only going to have fun when you are winning otherwise if you end up playing the game for 10000 hours like me, you will only enjoy 5000 hours of gameplay with a 50% winrate. If you are eager to play this game, the most overpowered ability everyone can use in game is the mute button, pre-mute the entire lobby upon loading in. If your team start losing, 9/10 either you will be flamed (even if you are playing well) or the whole team cohesion breaks down.   If the reason you want to play this game is to enjoy the teamplay and social aspect of playing a 5 vs 5 competitive game, I suggest you play something else. If you want to challenge yourself as a solo player, focus on your game entirely and develop your skill... then this game is extremely rewarding as you get better. I love this game and always will, but I am in love with the game itself and certainly not the people who play it. These people have nothing else going on in their lives and are essentially gambling with their serotonin, if they winning they are happy and if they losing they are children.  To put it into perspective, I come home from a long day of work and maybe play 1 or 2 games, I play something fun and creative, like a hero that is usually an offlane hero as a carry, if we win I'm a legend, if we lose people start crying and start pointing the finger. I have fun regardless because of the mute button, but if you don't have thick skin, this game will negatively affect your happiness.  Good luck and have fun, praying that the community treats you well (although I doubt it).","baik"

"76561198051539046","I've been playing Dota since its early days as a custom map in Warcraft III long before Dota 2 became the global phenomenon it is today. For me, this isn't just a game it's a huge part of my childhood and personal growth.  From Dota 1 to Dota 2, I've witnessed how the game evolved so called new mechanics, updated heroes, refined graphics, and better matchmaking systems. While some changes felt overwhelming at first, I’ve come to appreciate that evolution is part of what makes Dota such a masterpiece. It constantly challenges you to adapt, learn, and grow.  But Dota is more than just a game of mechanics and skill. It’s taught me so much about critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and even how to manage my emotions during high-pressure, often chaotic moments. Every match is unpredictable and that’s what makes it endlessly rewarding.  My Advice: Don’t play this game if you have low patience, poor communication, or if you prefer solo gameplay.  Dota is not for trolls or for those who take team coordination lightly.  If you're ready to be humbled, challenged, and (eventually) sharpened—welcome aboard.  This game holds many cherished memories, including countless moments with online friends I've made along the way. Some of them are no longer with us, and I want to say: RIP to my fallen teammates—you’ll always be part of my journey.  Cheers to Dota—for being more than just a game. It’s a lifelong lesson in resilience, strategy, and camaraderie. GGWP. GGEZ ","baik"

"76561198307637623","With over 3,800 hours poured into Dota 2, I can confidently say this game is more than just a pastime, it's a way of life. Every match is a new challenge, where strategy, teamwork, and skill are constantly put to the test. No two games are ever the same, and that’s what makes it so addicting. The depth of mechanics, hero variety, and the ever-evolving meta keep things fresh even after thousands of hours.  The feeling of executing the perfect team fight, landing that game-changing Black Hole, or carrying your team to victory after a grueling 60-minute battle is unmatched. But on the flip side, the game will test your patience like nothing else. The highs are incredible, but the lows can be brutal. It's a game that rewards dedication and punishes mistakes, making every win feel truly earned.  The community can be intense, and the learning curve is steep, but once you get past the initial struggle, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Whether you're playing casually or grinding ranked, every match teaches you something new. Even after thousands of hours, I still find myself improving and discovering new ways to outplay opponents.  Dota 2 is not just a game, it's a never-ending battle of wits and reflexes that keeps you coming back for more. If you’re willing to invest the time and effort, it’s one of the most satisfying and competitive experiences out there...","baik"
"76561198306460118","Dota 2 is both curse and blessing.  A battlefield that pulls you in with joy, then spits you out with hate.  You promise yourself never again—yet the taste lingers, and you return.    I play when I’m happy, when I’m broken, when my mind drowns in endless storms.  This is not a game for soft hearts.  It is for those who crave to feel, to bleed, to struggle, to conquer.  For those who want to clash with others, raw and unfiltered, no masks, no censorship.    Dota 2 is not just a game.

"76561198973752699","I learned to love Dota 2 by playing support at 2 AM, buying wards I swore I couldn’t afford, and watching a hopeless lane become winnable because the map finally made sense. This game is a long conversation with your past self. Yesterday you overextended for one more range creep. Today you drag the wave, plant a sentry on instinct, and live to tell the story.  The magic is how cause and effect stay visible. Win a fight near an objective and the whole river tilts in your favor. Lose a fight with buybacks down and you can feel the punishment in your bones. Patches change the surface, but the logic underneath remains readable. If you pay attention, Dota forgives slower than most games, and teaches faster than you expect.  People joke that nothing feels better than a rampage, but my favorite moments are quieter. A smoke that threads the needle between two wards. A carry who trusts a risky call because you pinged it with confidence. A glimpse of a courier path that gives away an ancient stack. These are tiny, human victories that never show up on the scoreboard and somehow matter most.  If you are new, you do not need encyclopedic knowledge. Learn why vision wins fights. Learn that it is okay to trade farm for tempo. Mute early when needed and keep the chat wheel for jokes, not judgment. Pick two or three heroes that make you curious and keep them until your hands know the buttons before your brain does. There is a day when you stop panicking at the minimap and start reading it. That day changes everything.  To the folks at Valve, thank you for making a competitive game that still feels handcrafted. The silhouettes remain readable, the replays are a gift, and the client gets out of the way when it matters. If I could ask for anything, it would be richer first hour guidance and more guardrails around early social friction. The moment someone feels their first real swing of agency, they stay.  I recommend Dota 2 because it stays interesting in the small details long after the big ones are familiar. It is stubborn, brilliant, occasionally infuriating, and somehow the perfect place to spend a late night with four names you may never meet and a plan that might actually work.

"76561198371877721","Dota 2 is a giant, living puzzle. Every match asks you to read the draft, map, timings, and items, and then make five people row in the same direction. The high points are unmatched: a perfectly timed smoke, a clutch buyback into Roshan, or a base defense that flips the game in thirty seconds. Frequent patches keep the meta fresh without deleting everything you learned.  The price of entry is real. The tutorial barely scratches the surface, solo queue can be unforgiving, and the information firehose hits you before you’ve built the mental models to parse it. Long matches also mean every mistake has time to snowball.  Form a small group, pick a few comfort heroes, and commit to communication, and Dota becomes endlessly rewarding.

It consumes time, nerves, and your soul. But that’s exactly why it’s legendary.  Verdict: If you want a casual game, play something else. If you want to suffer, improve, and feel real competitive highs — play Dota 2. 10/10. No MOBA comes close.  Better than League of Legends. Period.

"76561198242530534","(Played from 2015–2020)  Dota 2 is an amazing game, no doubt about it. The complexity, variety, and depth make it a masterpiece in its genre. No two matches are ever the same, which keeps things fresh and exciting every time you play. It’s especially fun with friends, where teamwork and coordination can lead to some of the most satisfying victories you’ll ever experience in gaming.  But beware—this game is highly addictive. Once you're in, it’s hard to let go. The thrill of improving, the rush of a good play, and the challenge of outsmarting your opponents create a loop that’s incredibly difficult to break. For me, Dota 2 became more than a game—it was a daily ritual for five years.  However, it’s not all perfect. Playing with strangers can sometimes ruin the experience, especially when someone decides to throw the game or has a bad attitude. And the addictive nature of Dota 2 can make it all-consuming if you’re not careful.  That said, I somehow managed to quit in 2020. Breaking free wasn’t easy, but I’m glad I did. Still, I’ll always respect what this game offers—its unmatched strategy, intense gameplay, and unforgettable moments. If you’re thinking of diving into Dota 2, just be prepared for the time and energy it demands.  TLDR: A brilliant, highly addictive game that’s best enjoyed with friends.

All heroes are available from the start, no paywalls, and every match feels intense because one mistake can completely change the game. Matches are longer, but you’re on edge the whole time.    The buyback mechanic, being able to teleport anywhere, and the crazy amount of item combinations really make the game deep. I still struggle with learning all the items, but that’s part of what keeps it fun you can play the same hero in so many different ways. What I personally love the most is the courier.

I used to play this game all day till next day morning but sometimes it would mentally destroy me. Toxicity, voice chat toxicity from others, pinging, blaming, etc. But on the bright side sometimes you can meet some people who become your close friends and it's fun playing together. It takes a lot of time to learn all the mechanics, items, heroes but it depends on the player. I used to play only Jakiro for more than 1000 times.

"76561197970870292","Well.... I've played for 1k hours and I still suck. But somehow this game is still incredibly fun, no matter the frustration that occurs when you think your team is well built and you end up getting stomped. I don't know how a game with only one map is still fun after 1k hours, but this one certainly is.     The matchmaking is so incredibly atrocious. It tells you a game is a good match when one person on the other team has more MVPs than your entire team has games played. That, or you get matched against a group of noobs and even if you try to play nice, you still end up stomping them. Its the games in between those two that keep me coming back. The ones where it is back and forth and neither side knows who is going to win until the ancient falls. The ones where you think you're about to lose, and somehow you and your team are able to win a good team fight and dive right down the middle and destroy their ancient while none of them have buybacks.     Its silly fun. There are a lot of D-bags though. Use the mute function. But, if youre new, make sure you can see and hear what your team is saying until you confirm they are jerks.

I recommend trying a few bot matches to get the hang of things with heroes and play styles before jumping into online, at least that's what I did and now I feel more confident playing against others.

"76561199272677140","Dota 2 is one of the most complex, punishing, and addictive games you’ll ever play. The learning curve isn’t just steep—it’s a cliff. New players will get crushed repeatedly, often with little explanation. The community can be toxic, especially to beginners, and mistakes (even small ones) are rarely forgiven.  Matches are long, intense, and mentally draining. You'll spend hundreds of hours just to feel ""okay"" at the game. And once you're hooked, it becomes a cycle of frustration, salt, and the occasional glorious win that keeps you coming back.  It’s not for the faint of heart—but if you’re a glutton for punishment and love a challenge, Dota 2 will consume your soul in the best (and worst) way possible.","baik"

There are so many heroes that sometimes I feel like I’m one of them – usually the one who dies first. Dota 2 teaches patience (mostly with random teammates), cooperation (with people yelling in seven different languages), and rewards you… well, when you actually win, you feel like the smartest being in the universe.

But for all its chaos, stress, and heartbreak, I keep coming back. And I know I’m not alone. Every match is a high-stakes battle of wits, skill, and decision-making. One minute you’re coordinating the perfect teamfight, the next you’re questioning your life choices after a disastrous throw. It’s brutal, it’s punishing, and somehow, it’s still incredibly rewarding. There’s something addictive about the depth of this game — the endless strategies, the hero pool, the meta shifts, the synergy between teammates (or lack thereof). Even when I rage-quit, I find myself queuing up again, chasing that one perfect game. Dota 2 isn’t for everyone. It can be toxic, frustrating, and deeply unforgiving.

It’s those moments when the game seems lost, and then out of nowhere, you pull off an unbelievable play that turns the tide, and your heart races as the entire team erupts in excitement. It’s the bond you form with your teammates, even if you’ve never met them before, united by a shared goal and that deep, unspoken understanding of the game’s intensity. Dota 2 teaches you about resilience, about the highs and lows of victory and defeat, and how every mistake is a lesson. There’s something about that rush of a well-executed strategy, the thrill of pushing forward to take that final tower, that makes Dota 2 more than just a game—it’s an emotional experience that stays with you long after the match is over.","baik"
"76561198427462854","Recommended  Dota 2 is like that epic teen summer camp you never stop raving about! 🌟 I freaking LOVED this game, even though I was an absolute trainwreck at it! I spent a few hours teaming up with my cousin, my ultimate ""squad"", trying to rule the lanes and drop some sick ultimates, but let’s be real—I was a walking disaster! 😂 I gave up because, well, I’m the problem, not Dota. This game is a flawless beast of strategy and madness, with maps that pop and heroes that feel like they leapt out of a blockbuster. I made friends so awesome we’re still memeing in group chats, and yeah, I racked up some iconic enemies too (lol, sorry to that guy I fed in mid!). 😎 It defined my youth with screams and giggles, even if I was more minion than master. If you love MOBAs and aren’t a total flop like me, dive into this gem! 🗡️   Pros:  Perfect game with strategy that’s pure genius (or not).  Matches with my cousin that were chaotic bliss.  Epic friendships and hilarious rivalries (haha).  Stunning visuals and heroes that steal the show.   Cons:  Learning curve steeper than a rocket launch.  Community can get a bit spicy sometimes.","baik"
"76561197967288976","If you’ve ever thought, “I’d like to systematically erode my will to live while being yelled at in Russian,” Dota 2 is the game for you. With over 7000 hours invested — or, more accurately, irretrievably discarded — I can confidently say that Dota 2 doesn’t just suck your soul. It files a change-of-ownership form with the devil, adds your essence to a punch card, and hands you a battle pass as consolation.    The thrill of logging in has long since devolved into a Pavlovian dread-response. Each match is less a game and more a hostage negotiation where your captors are twelve-year-olds with no filter, teammates who pick Techies unironically, and a matchmaking system that could be replaced by a blindfolded chimp throwing darts at a dartboard labeled “MMR.”    The community, if we can even call it that, is a vibrant mosaic of dysfunction. A glorious melting pot of racism, slurs, death threats, and unsolicited life advice from people who unironically use anime profile pictures and think “support diff” is a valid argument.    Friendships? Gone. Relationships? Dismantled. Playing Dota 2 with someone you love is like renovating a house with them: one of you will end up in therapy, and the other will just leave. If you want to test the strength of any bond, forget trust falls. Queue up for ranked.    And yet, despite everything — the emotional scarring, the social carnage, the existential despair — the game calls you back. Not with excitement, but with grim obligation. Like paying taxes. Or visiting a relative in the hospital who doesn’t remember your name but still manages to call you a disappointment.    Dota 2 is not a game. It’s a lifestyle choice. A bad one. Like ketamine at a children’s party.    Play it if you must. But know this: Dota 2 doesn't just ruin your day. It ruins your decade.","baik"
"76561198083553340","Introduction Dota 2 is an iconic multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve Corporation. Released in 2013, the game is the successor to the Warcraft III: Defense of the Ancients (DotA) modification and has since grown into one of the main esports titans. Its complex gameplay, endless strategic depth, and active community make it a unique phenomenon in the gaming industry.  Gameplay: Skill vs. Tactics Dota 2 is based on battles between two teams of five players, the goal of which is to destroy the enemy ""fortress"" (Ancient), while protecting their own. Each player controls a unique hero with a set of abilities that develop during the match. Here, not only reaction and mechanical skill are important, but also team coordination, choice of tactics, and map control.  - Heroes and roles: More than 120 heroes with different roles (tanks, support, carry, mages) allow you to endlessly experiment with combinations. - Items and Progression: Gold and XP earned in combat unlock powerful items and upgrades, adding layers of strategy.  - Match Dynamics: Games last between 20 and 60 minutes, with the outcome often decided in decisive team skirmishes.  Graphics and Sound: Functionality and Atmosphere Dota 2 doesn’t strive for photorealism, but its vibrant art style and detailed maps have stood the test of time. Regular visual updates and ability effects are pleasing to the eye. The sound design perfectly complements the gameplay: unique hero lines, ability cues, and epic music at critical moments enhance immersion.  Features and Community - Free-to-Play: All in-game benefits are available without paying. Purchases only concern cosmetics (skins, animations), which maintains balance. - Esports: The International tournament attracts millions of viewers every year, and prize pools reach tens of millions of dollars. - Tutorials and Community: The game offers tutorials and modes for beginners, but the steep learning curve means there is a high barrier to entry. The community is active, but sometimes toxic, which is something to consider.  Pros: + Incredible strategic depth and replayability. + Regular updates and support from Valve. + Vibrant esports scene and spectacular tournaments. + Fair monetization without pay-to-win.  Cons: - Complexity for beginners: requires time to master the mechanics and meta. - Potentially toxic players in public matches. - Match lengths can be tiring.  Conclusion Dota 2 is a game for those willing to dedicate time to learning its mechanics and nuances. It rewards skill, teamwork, and strategic thinking, while remaining one of the most complex and intense MOBAs on the market. If you're looking for a challenge, want to dive into the eSports culture, or just enjoy fast-paced tactical battles, Dota 2 is worth a try. However, those who prefer casual gameplay or are afraid of high difficulty may want to consider other titles in the genre.","baik"

"76561198321346754","[h3]TLDR: It's a good game, give it a chance, but don't let it consume your life. Treat it as a video game, not your job, and have fun.[/h3]    It will consume your life if you let it.    But that doesn't mean it's a bad game. Dota will teach you multiple things, particularly [strike]discipline[/strike] and thinking when making decisions.    The game is pretty complex, so it might scare newbies however, if you give it a chance and take it day by day, you'll understand why there is such a big following for this game throughout the years.    It's up to you, the player, to create item builds or potential metas. Although each patch creates a meta that is usually formed by a group of Esport teams which the casuals follow, that doesn't mean there isn't potential for new item builds or plays.     You shouldn't let people force item builds, etc., or limit your creativity this game belongs to you as much as to them. Create the crazy builds, combos, whatever your heart allows.    As this game has a ranked matchmaking system, a lot of people rage or get angry if you try something new. This is understandable, as trying new things in ranked games usually fails, and as a result, you might waste the time of your teammates who are grinding to reach high ranks.  I suggest that you should practice new stuff in Turbo or other game modes, as these don't have a consequence of losing rank when losing.    Also, there's a big community aspect in this game. If you check out the Dota Arcade Tab, you'll be able to see different fun/crazy games created by people just like you. This is pretty fun if you want to play in a different setting. It's hard to list every aspect of this game, but I suggest giving it a try.    The tutorial of Dota is not good, so people usually uninstall the game once they complete it.   Please don't be one of those people, and try to give it a chance.   If you have a friend that plays the game, you should party queue with them (only if they are not tryhards and genuinely enjoy the game).  Another possible route is to watch YouTube videos to get an intro to the game. I used to watch PurgeGamers back in the day, but his videos are quite old and are of Dota in early patches.    So it might be better to watch new YouTubers who teach the game, such as Grubby or BSJ, for an intro to the game.    ","baik"

"76561199806659226","Dota 2 isn’t a game.  It’s a crime scene I keep returning to, even though I know exactly how the blood will dry.    I hate it — the chaos, the ego, the teammates auditioning for a documentary called How to Ruin a Lead in 30 Minutes. Every match feels like a slow dissection of my patience. And yet… I queue again. Like a moth circling the same flame that’s already burned its wings clean off.    Dota punishes you with precision. It studies you. It waits. Then it gives you one perfect moment — the clutch fight, the immaculate execution, the hit of dopamine sharp enough to make you forget all the misery that came before it.  That’s the trick.  That’s how the darkness keeps you.    I don’t play because I love it.  I play because somewhere between the frustration and the thrill, I found a part of myself that refuses to let go.

"76561199874633186","Dota 2 is one of the most influential and enduring multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games ever created. Developed by Valve, it has become a true classic of competitive gaming, with a global community and a professional scene that has shaped modern esports.    At its core, Dota 2 is a 5v5 strategy game where players choose from a vast roster of unique heroes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles. The goal is simple in theory but incredibly complex in practice: destroy the enemy’s Ancient before they destroy yours. What makes the game so compelling is the depth of its mechanics—every match feels different because of the countless possible hero combinations, item builds, and team strategies.    The game’s steep learning curve is both its biggest challenge and its greatest strength. New players may find themselves overwhelmed by the complexity, but those who invest time are rewarded with unmatched depth and satisfaction. No two games are ever alike, and small decisions often determine victory or defeat.    Visually, Dota 2 is polished and constantly updated, with new cosmetics, seasonal events, and balance patches keeping the experience fresh. The competitive scene, highlighted by The International—the game’s premier tournament with record-breaking prize pools—remains a spectacle that attracts millions of viewers worldwide.    Dota 2 is not for everyone. It requires patience, teamwork, and resilience. But for those willing to embrace its difficulty, it offers one of the richest and most rewarding multiplayer experiences in gaming.","baik"
"76561198124921293","I recommend playing Dota 2 to other players because it is a highly strategic and competitive game that challenges both your critical thinking and teamwork skills.

The game also teaches patience, decision-making, and coordination with teammates, making victories feel truly rewarding. Beyond the gameplay, Dota 2 has a strong global community and regular updates that keep it fresh and exciting. Whether you enjoy fast-paced action, deep strategy, or working with others to achieve victory, Dota 2 is an experience worth trying.","baik"

"76561199212794929","Dota 2 is the granddaddy of making you question every life choice, but in the best way possible. It’s not just a MOBA it’s Valve’s never-ending science experiment where five strangers try to cooperate (and usually flame each other) for an hour, all because someone picked Techies.  At first glance, you’re like, “Okay, just smash their Ancient, got it.” But then you realize there’s a billion tiny things to juggle: weird hero powers, bonkers item builds, and a meta that changes faster than Twitter drama. Over 120 heroes, by the way, so good luck learning them all. Every match is like opening a new puzzle box, except sometimes it explodes in your face.  The gameplay? Absolute chaos, but with a rhythm. You’re farming, you’re warding, you’re yelling at your carry for stealing your last hit. One second you’re a farming bot, next you’re in a teamfight where one missed spell means instant regret. Sometimes you pull off a sick play and feel like a genius other times you misclick and want to uninstall. That’s Dota, baby.  And don’t get me started on the learning curve, it’s more like falling off a cliff. You’ll lose. A lot. Even the pros keep getting blindsided by new patches. Valve loves to shake things up: new items, hero reworks, weird balance changes. Blink and you’re outdated.  But when you finally get it, like really nail a combo or outsmart the enemy? That rush is unreal. Every game tells a different story personalities flare, egos clash, someone always blames the support. It’s beautiful chaos.  Visually, Dota 2’s got style. Clean graphics, flashy spells, and you can actually tell what’s happening (most of the time). The sound design? Legendary. That announcer pack calling your rampage, pure dopamine.  Let’s talk esports for a sec. The International isn’t just another tourney, it’s basically the Super Bowl of nerds, raining ridiculous amounts of cash and hype. The Dota community is wild, sometimes toxic, but always passionate. They’ll argue about the meta for days, but that’s half the fun.  At the end of the day, Dota 2 isn’t for quitters. It wants your brain, your reflexes, your soul. But if you’re up for the challenge, there’s nothing quite like it. It’s the ultimate game of wits, teamwork, and occasionally, pure chaos.

"76561198865895697","The Game is simple and yet it require you to at least have 100 hrs to understand the basics of the game. The wide range of heroes and items makes this game a little complicated for the new comers which is fine if you are ready to invest your time in it at least 100 hrs for basics and 500 hrs to understand heroes and their abilities, items.  The game have 5 positions and 3 lanes on each side with each position having their part to play in the game. Its a proper team game you cannot side on your teammate's shoulder for a free ride. As far as i understand the game the key 5 positions are 1st the carry as the name describe you gotta do it if your are pos 1. 2nd The mid either you make the game or break the game simple. 3rd Offlane you are the face of the frontline act like it. 4th Soft support you gotta make the plays with you team. 5th hard support you gotta protect your teammate even if it means sacrificing your life. Knowledge is power in this game knowing what to make at what time to make is very essential and crucial to the game.  The game community is not kind and sweet its a competitive game either you win or you lose no in between. The game offers you wide range of communication to use and communicate with your team please use it. The learning is very fun but once you know YOU KNOW.

"76561198181088699","Look, Dota is a Moba and I think people have a perception of Mobas (especially more well known ones) being toxic gaming environment for people who have nothing better to do with their lives. This perception is fair but I think Dota is great for a  few reasons that if you mesh with, great! Give the game a try. If you don't think any of these appeal to you, completely fair.  1. You live for the high of a game. A lot of the gameplay in Dota is nothing crazy. But every now and then you do a crazy play or sequence of events that as soon as it's over you're like ""What the fuck?! I can't believe I just did that!"" There can be different variations but while these moments are rare they feel incredible and can keep pushing you forward. If you're someone who wants a more consistent dopamine rush maybe not the best for you.  2. You love to see yourself improving. Not so much of a dopamine rush, but Dota has a stupid high skill ceiling. You can almost always see yourself slowly improving over time from last hitting, map awareness, itemization, drafting, and anything in between. It's a very satisfying but not exciting feeling that I enjoy and I think plays a big role into why I still play this game, and also why I don't consider these dopamine rushes. I will also take this chance to say as someone who's played both, I do think Dota is more difficult than Lol.  3. You have people play with. Yeah it's crazy huh? Turns out that if you're playing a multiplayer game, it's almost always more fun to have people to play the game with you. Hell, just having friends who you can talk about the game with makes it substantially more fun and engaging. It doesn't need to be friends starting the game at the same time as you but it's nice if you have a friend or group that wants to give it a try.   Overall, Dota is a frustrating but also rewarding game with a steep learning process. If you ever want to take the time to learn the ins and outs of a game then I highly recommend giving it a try.","baik"

"76561198027758678","I wandered into enemy territory like Dora the Explorer and got ganked into the afterlife. Would get ganked again :)  🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics 🎮 Dota 2 is mechanically deep. It's clear that once you understand its systems - items, roles, combos, counters - you can really shine. Even in just two matches, I could feel how high the skill ceiling is and how rewarding it might be with time. Abilities feel impactful, character movement is clean, and the variety of playable heroes is impressive.  That said, the gameplay felt overwhelming at first. Between map objectives, the item shop, and general combat flow, it throws a lot at you quickly. If you don’t already know what you’re doing or take time to study up, it’s easy to feel behind.  👀 Visuals & Aesthetic 👀 This part genuinely surprised me. Dota 2 looks great. It's clean, colourful, and less cluttered than other MOBAS I’ve tried. The UI is still packed with info, but the combat visuals are sharp. Animations are smooth, and the game feels polished across the board.  🧠 Learning Curve 🧠 I skipped the tutorial at first, and that was a mistake. My first match was rough - I didn’t understand the shop, my abilities, or what I was supposed to do. Once I went back and played the tutorial, I understood a lot more, but even then, it was clear that I’d need to put in several hours to play competently. This isn’t a quick, jump-in-and-go type of game. It’s meant for players who enjoy studying mechanics and improving over time.  🤝 Team Communication 🤝 This was a weak spot for me. I tried typing, and even calling things out in chat - but got almost no response. If you’re someone who values communication and team coordination, solo queue might feel a bit lifeless. Playing without friends made the whole experience feel more disconnected than I expected.  💰 Monetization 💰 No complaints here. There’s a huge selection of cosmetics, but they didn’t feel overpriced or aggressive. It feels like a game built for long-term investment, and the monetization reflects that in a fair way.  ✅ Final Verdict ✅ Dota 2 is a great game. It’s polished, smartly designed, and clearly built for people who want to invest real time into learning it. But for me, it’s just not the kind of game I enjoy long-term.  I respect it, I get the appeal, and I actually had fun with the chaos of learning. But I don’t see myself coming back to it. You'll probably love this if you’re into high-skill, team-focused strategy games and have the patience to learn. If not, you’ll bounce off it just like I did.","baik"

The graphics are solid, the sounds are immersive, and the sheer variety of strategies makes it one of the most rewarding games when things go right. But make no mistake: Dota 2 is not friendly to newcomers. The learning curve is basically a wall. It can be frustrating, punishing, and downright toxic—especially when teammates decide to jungle Pudge at 40 minutes.    Now, let’s talk about the real villain here: Volodyka. That guy convinced me to try Dota 2, and I’ve been stuck in this cycle of pain and addiction ever since. Thanks a lot, Volodyka.

"76561198087359542","Dota 2: The Pinnacle of Competitive Game Design.  There are video games, and then there is Dota 2—a colossal masterpiece, a test of intellect, reflexes, teamwork, and strategic depth that remains unmatched in the gaming world. Born from the custom Warcraft III mod “Defense of the Ancients,” and nurtured into a full-fledged phenomenon by Valve Corporation, Dota 2 stands not merely as a game, but as a living, breathing arena of infinite possibility.    A Symphony of Complexity.  At its core, Dota 2 is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). Simple in premise, but what lies beneath is an ocean of interwoven mechanics, constantly shifting metas, and limitless skill expression.    Over 120 unique heroes, each with four or more abilities, synergies, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no templates here. Every hero is a universe.    Hundreds of items, each changing the dynamics of a fight, farm, or strategy. Itemization is not routine it's adaptive, reactionary, and highly situational.    No two matches are the same. The fog of war, real-time decision-making, unpredictable enemy movement, and the emergent behaviors of ten distinct human players mean that Dota 2 evolves every second, every game.    Where most games reward mechanical prowess or reflexes, Dota 2 demands it alongside macro knowledge, drafting intelligence, map awareness, timing, risk assessment, and an almost spiritual level of synergy with your teammates. It is chess with a pulse, and every move can echo into triumph or defeat.    No Pay to Win, All Skill.  One of Dota 2’s most defining traits is its purely skill-based model. Every hero is free. Every mechanic is transparent. There are no advantages sold—only cosmetics. Every victory is earned, every defeat is a lesson, and every player shares the exact same tools. The difference is in how you use them.    There is no hiding in Dota. Skill, knowledge, communication, and experience are laid bare in every move. This is why the game attracts the sharpest minds and most passionate players.    The Tactical Depth of a War Room.  Unlike many modern games that simplify gameplay loops to maximize appeal, Dota 2 embraces complexity—and the player base reveres it. Consider:    Drafting phase: Even before the game begins, the psychological warfare has started. Bans, picks, counters, combos—this is a metagame in itself.    Laning stage: Not just farming. It's about lane control, pulling, stacking, zoning, power spike timing, and reading the opponent's intent.    Mid to late game: It's a mental gauntlet. You think like a general. You calculate Roshan timings, smoke ganks, tower trade-offs, vision wars, cooldowns, buybacks, and split-push potential—all in real time.    Every decision can spiral the game in a different direction. Dota 2 does not reward random aggression it rewards calculated violence.    Community, History, and Esports Glory.  Dota 2 birthed The International, the most prestigious esports tournament in history—its prize pool funded directly by the community. TI finals are viewed by millions, not just for gameplay, but for the stories:    Underdog comebacks, Once-in-a-lifetime plays, Retirement runs and Cinderella moments    Legends are made on this battlefield. The community’s passion has kept the game evolving for over a decade, making it not just a game, but a shared mythos.    A Game That Grows With You.  Dota 2 has no ceiling. You can play for 10,000 hours and still learn something new. You become wiser, more disciplined, and more aware—not just in game, but in life. It teaches:    Patience (you will lose games for dumb mistakes)    Communication (you need to align five strangers into one unit)    Resilience (you will experience comebacks and heartbreaks)    Leadership and humility (sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow)    It sharpens your mind like few other digital experiences can. For those who crave mastery, Dota 2 is not just a game, it is a lifelong dojo.    Constantly Evolving, Yet Always Familiar.  Valve’s updates keep Dota alive, balancing nostalgia with innovation. From massive gameplay overhauls to subtle item tweaks, the game never stagnates. Patch notes are read like holy scripture, studied, debated, and then adapted to. It’s a cycle of rebirth every few months.    And yet, no matter how much it changes, Dota always feels like home. The radiant base. The dire cliffs. The pit where Roshan lives. These are etched in memory. It is your battlefield. Your proving ground.    Final Verdict: The Greatest Game Ever Made.  Dota 2 is art, science, sport, and strategy fused into one. It doesn’t coddle you. It demands your best, and it gives you the tools to find it. In a world increasingly defined by fast content and short attention spans, Dota 2 rewards depth, thought, and perseverance.    It may not be for everyone—but for those who seek the apex of digital competition, who dream of orchestrating five-man wombo combos and outplaying a whole team with one clutch move, Dota 2 is the undisputed throne.    It’s not just a game.    It’s the arena of gods.    Clan Doto Forever.    ","baik"

"76561198267934355","I would like to believe that this game had good intentions, never sought to intentionally harm anyone, and truly wanted to use its hour experience to create awareness towards child sexual crimes. I also believe that it can, at times, effectively disgust you, and fool you into thinking there is more to the game than its gross premise.    my d0Ooota 22  is an experience unlike any other, and it should be ashamed for it. Nobody, and certainly victims, need to be ""aware"" of the existence of child sexual assault in the manner it presents itself. Not only is it incredibly blunt in the laziest way possible, but the game immediately plays its biggest hand in the first 5 minutes when the player character, (a little girl who can be estimated to be as young as 11 years old and completely uneducated to the point her mental age seems far younger) expresses her distaste towards pills she's required to take every night because they make her tired. Immediately my eyes deceive throws all subtlety out the window, and just becomes a harrowing slog through the daily imprisonment of this poor child, and there's nothing the player can do but sit there and be complicit in the crime for another 30 minutes. And your reward for trusting the game to tell an interesting story, and going down the bad ending is a revolting line that reveals the unaware forced pregnancy of the child protagonist, only then to be given a credits scroll that attempts to empower victims, remind them they aren't alone in their experiences, and that they can always find strength in the struggle. What a gross, deaf thing to say after putting, who they would assume are victims, through this waste of time and art.    Shame on you, nouhidev, shame on you for engaging in a subject you do not understand, and taking a moral high ground on. Shame on you for wasting an hour of my life with a message that means nothing. Many people believe your game is based on the Josef Fritzl case which follows a similar story, and I am sad that anyone could believe you would be honoring the victims of Fritzl through this game. You are a depraved, blind human being who thought a post on r/TwoSentenceHorror about a falsely imprisoned child required your expert touch-ups of child molestation and drugging.    Shame on you, never make another game.    Helpful?  Yes  I have to agree that the little message in the credits is just a lame attempt at being empathetic. As someone who survived SA, yeah, cool, heard it multiple times, kind of tired of it. Kind of tired of being told I may be too sensitive to deal with fiction that deals with it too.    My issue isn't that it's ""triggering"" - it may be trying to shine a light on something that happens in reality, but it is still just fiction, and I can separate fiction from reality. My issue is that it's just kind of boring and reeks of pandering. The wait times for certain triggers are a bit too long and the keys feel ""sticky"", as if e and enter to confirm some things just don't work some times. I do appreciate there aren't any ""jump scares"" (there's a slight startle in one of the dream sequences but it's not associated with scary flashing lights, a ""scary"" face too close to the screen all of a sudden, or a truly deafening sting of any sort).

When I first opened the game I immediately recognized what this was based off of, which makes it so much worse. The only positive thing i can say is that it was very immersive, but I wouldn't recommend it.  A twisted, dark, and engaging narrative that gradually unravels itself over the course of the experience.  Includes sensitive and distressing subject matter, including highly triggering elements such as suggested sexual abuse. It may be deeply unsettling to some players.

"76561198253291986","Dota 2 is a game I love… but it wears me down with endless updates and constant rebalancing.  I've spent many years with this game. I’ve seen ages pass, heroes rise and fall, items appear and vanish. Dota 2 is more than just a game — it’s a battlefield of minds and wills, where every match tells a story. You don’t just press buttons here — you live a full life in one evening.  But with the years comes a kind of fatigue. Not from the game itself — from the fact that it is never allowed to settle.  Just as you get into it, adapt, master a hero, and begin to truly enjoy the experience — everything changes again. Not just small tweaks — entire systems are torn apart and rebuilt. The heroes you knew like a friends becomes a strangers. The item that defined your strategy is gone. The meta you were finally beginning to understand — swept away.  In other games, updates feel like a celebration. Here, they often feel like grief. Each patch in Dota is like a dagger to the heart. They remove beloved skills, rewrite familiar mechanics, endlessly reshuffle the balance. It feels less like creative improvement and more like compulsive tinkering.  If updates were less frequent, they would be anticipated, even welcomed — not met with a tired sigh of ""Oh no, another patch… again? Seriously?"" And please, stop endlessly tuning the balance. Focus on things that don’t rewrite the foundations every time.  I understand — the game needs to live. But there’s a difference between life and restlessness.  This is a competitive game. This is E-sports. In sports, the rules don’t change every few weeks. Where is the stability? Where is the respect for the player’s time and learning? It often feels like the changes exist just for the sake of having changes — not because they’re needed.  To the developers, if you happen to read this — please, slow down! Don’t ruin what’s good in pursuit of something ""better."" Not every structure needs rebuilding. Not every system needs redesign.  Yes, we welcome new heroes. Yes, we love new items and seasonal content. But not every week or month. Let the game breathe. Let us live in it, not constantly study it.  P.S. Special thanks to whoever created the Turbo mode. For those of us with jobs, families, and a life outside of Dota — it’s a blessing. Turbo is like a short, joyful story before bed. Fast, fun, and without burnout.  I still love this game. I have, and maybe always will — unless one day it’s changed so much it stops being the game I once loved. But like any weary warrior, I ask not for more battles — I ask for a moment of rest between them… and for the rules to stop changing. Dota is a classic. It’s chess. Stop rewriting how the pieces move.","baik"
"76561198261061047","Dota 2 is a legendary multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve. It features a 5v5 team format where each side aims to destroy the enemy base.  One of Dota 2’s strongest points is its depth and variety. The game has over 100 heroes, each with unique abilities and playstyles. This makes every match feel different and requires players to think strategically, work as a team, and react quickly.  The graphics and sound design are top-notch. The map is detailed, and the ability animations are visually pleasing. Regular updates from the developers bring balance changes, new heroes and items, and in-game events. Dota 2 also has a thriving esports scene — tournaments like The International attract millions of viewers and offer huge prize pools.  However, it’s worth noting that the game has a steep learning curve and can be unforgiving. New players may find it difficult to get into, and the community can sometimes be toxic.

"76561199145317720","An amazing game. It has been lacking a Battle Pass of late so there's no real incnetive to play, other than just to enjoy the game itself. I'm one of those players that does enjoy a Battle Pass or even small events in game that award players with skins, etc. With that being said DOTA is fun enough to be able to look past that.   The learning curve can be quite steep, but once the basics are covered, DOTA is enjoyable. You can see your skills gradually develop and every game can be a learning experience.

"76561198275429363","If you dedicate a few hundred hours to learning the ropes, you will have fun. I've never played a more mechanically challenging game before. And somehow, it never gets boring. There is simply too many heroes, items and viable hero builds, that even in hour 700 you can still try something new and refreshing. But the biggest win for Dota 2 is the rare satisfaction in playing against highly skilled opponents, and still outwitting them and winning anyway. That's Dota 2 at its best.    Simultaneously, however, you will learn to hate yourself and everyone else. Your teammates will snap at you and each other more often than not. Internal drama, infighting, griefing, general toxicity and all the worst hallmarks of competitive online games.    If you do play, I recommend taking a month or two off every once in a while. Mental detox. Good for you.","baik"
"76561198043610692","Wonderful game! Great gameplay, great graphics, fun for hours and hours, it never gets old.   Message to devs:  You guys are doing a great job at retention, but the game would also greatly benefit from having more people play. For this, it needs to be more accessible to beginners, and casual players.  1- fix smurfing. Currently the main issue holding back the potential of the game in non ranked games (where casual players hang). Reporting is not enough, smurf accounts need to be banned, and IPs creating several smurf accounts need to be prevented to do so.  2- Improve beginners experience. The tutorial is good, but limiting playable heroes at start just creates frustration when new players can't play their favorite hero. Instead, have suggested heroes. Match making amongst players with 0 games or 0 victory is a must have (and of course coupled with the smurf fix above). Bots training is great but it's boring. It's very important to let beginners play with other beginners.  3- Skin quality. This is a much lower priority item, but it could really improve monetization. Many base models and old skins have really poor model/texture/etc. quality. The reward of receiving a random skin after a game is negated if said skin is so poor quality that it's not even worth equiping. Also, one of the stregth of Dota2 against competitors is the visual quality, so making sure all models have a consistent baseline quality, and staying coherent with the universe, is key to preserve and emphasize this strength.  Cheers!","baik"

Огромное количество героев, предметов и комбинаций делает геймплей по настоящему безграничным, а командная работа и грамотная тактика позволяют почувствовать себя частью чего-то большого.    Особенно радует, что игра постоянно развивается: разработчики регулярно добавляют новый контент, обновляют баланс и проводят крутые события. Атмосфера соревновательности и драйва заряжает энергией, а красивые визуальные эффекты и музыкальное сопровождение создают особое настроение.    Dota 2 - это не просто игра, это целый мир, где можно найти друзей, испытать радость побед и даже научиться важным вещам, например: терпению, стратегии, умению работать в команде.

"76561198367471798","Few games have shaped the esports landscape as profoundly as Dota 2. Developed by Valve, this free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) stands as a towering giant in competitive gaming—complex, rewarding, and fiercely strategic.  At its core, Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other in a battle to destroy the opposing team’s Ancient, a heavily guarded structure deep within their base. With over a hundred unique heroes, each boasting distinct abilities, playstyles, and roles, no two matches feel the same.  The game balances macromanagement of the battlefield with micromanagement of your hero’s growth—you’ll be farming gold, buying items, coordinating with teammates, ganking enemies, and executing game-changing team fights. It’s a demanding dance of skill, strategy, and split-second decision-making.  Dota 2 is notoriously complex. Its steep learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, but the depth is precisely what has kept the community thriving for years. Every patch introduces balance changes, new items, and sometimes new heroes, ensuring the meta continually evolves.  Mastering one hero, let alone the entire roster, requires time and dedication—but the satisfaction of outplaying an opponent or turning the tide in a crucial moment is unparalleled.  Visually, Dota 2 is colorful and detailed, with each hero uniquely animated and designed to stand out. The maps are richly textured, providing clear tactical information while remaining aesthetically pleasing. Sound design is top-notch, with distinct voice lines, spell effects, and ambient noises contributing to the immersive experience.  With one of the largest esports scenes globally, Dota 2’s The International tournament offers multi-million-dollar prize pools and draws millions of viewers worldwide. The community is passionate, vocal, and dedicated, though the competitive nature can sometimes lead to a steep social environment.  Dota 2 is a monument to strategic depth and player skill—a game that rewards patience, teamwork, and creativity. If you’re willing to invest the time, it offers a rich, endlessly evolving battlefield where every match is a new story.  Complex, competitive, and compelling—Dota 2 remains the pinnacle of MOBA excellence.  Rating: 9/10","baik"

If overly complex tactics and strategies are overwhelming. This game isn't for you.  There are a lot of variables, synergies, counters maneuvers, tactics etc to consider. There is a very large learning curve, many players do not reach the plateau of this curve , never mind the peak. The game is un-fun for people below this plateau. Imagine trying to play football without knowing what an offside, a field goal  or a punt is.   There are layers to understanding where a concept clicks and you think you understand, yet you are not seeing the bigger picture.  Football is considerably simpler but an analogy would be:  ""I am run ball, I am reach back, points is good, Don't get tackle. Sometimes I can throw, I'm master tactician""  -Most people     If you have a competitive heart and are prepared practice and fail to get better to achieve better skill expression this is one of the best games for that.    This is the original and best MOBA. I've played most of the big name competitors.  LOL can't match the depth and the strategy. HON being a clone did a good impression.  The game is a well executed strategic staple that will go down as one of the greats.    DOTA does have issues with the developers keeping their favorite heroes at the top of meta and keeping broken stuff in game because of fan noise also there are issues with rank assignment and smurfing in public games now that the game is older and less attention is paid to those kind of problems. These can be complex issues to solve and most games have similar issues.    TLDR  One of the best games ever, not for filthy casuals. Get good or move on.","baik"

"76561198055553404","I’ve played Dota → HOTS → LoL → Dota again. From experience, Dota’s strategic depth is far ahead of its competitors. Itemization, hero design, and core mechanics all have a much greater impact on how each game plays out.  If you prefer micro over macro play, Dota still holds up. It focuses less on pure skill shots and more on positioning, timing, and decision-making. With its many active items and abilities, you often manage anywhere from 2 to 13 buttons, sometimes even controlling multiple units with their own skills.  LoL feels faster and more reaction-based. You die quicker, and crowd control is usually shorter and easier to dodge. In Dota, disables tend to last longer, which shifts the focus toward planning and positioning rather than constant reflexes.  After returning to Dota, I can’t go back to LoL. Dota’s hero and item design are more engaging, and fights feel more deliberate—you don’t just evaporate instantly.  Bonus points to Dota for its launcher and cosmetics—you can customize music, merge skins, and the client works flawlessly. I once saw a streamer in a match pause, open demo mode to test an interaction, and resume the game within seconds. It’s simply more polished.","baik"

"76561198297852934","Dota 2 – A Ruthless, Ever-Evolving Test of Skill and Strategy  Developer: Valve Release Date: July 9, 2013 Platforms: PC (Windows, Linux)  Overview Dota 2 is not just a multiplayer game—it’s a commitment. From the very first match, it makes one thing clear: this is a game that does not hold your hand, does not forgive mistakes easily, and demands your full attention. As a five-versus-five competitive MOBA, Dota 2 pits two teams against each other in a battle of strategy, mechanical skill, teamwork, and mental endurance. Playing Dota 2 today feels like stepping into a living ecosystem that has been refined, expanded, and reshaped countless times. Every match tells its own story, filled with comebacks, clutch plays, devastating missteps, and moments of pure brilliance. It’s brutal, complex, and often frustrating—but for those willing to learn it, Dota 2 offers one of the deepest and most rewarding competitive experiences in gaming.  What Makes It Great? ✅ Unmatched Strategic Depth Dota 2’s greatest strength is its depth. With over a hundred heroes, countless item combinations, and near-infinite strategic possibilities, no two matches ever feel the same. Drafting alone is a game within the game—counter-picks, synergies, and bans can decide the outcome before the match even begins. Every decision matters: when to push, when to farm, when to fight, when to sacrifice yourself for the team. The level of strategic freedom is staggering, and mastering it feels incredibly rewarding.  ✅ Heroes With True Identity Unlike many MOBAs where characters feel interchangeable, Dota 2’s heroes are wildly distinct. Each hero has a unique playstyle, strengths, weaknesses, and personality. From complex spellcasters like Invoker to mechanically demanding carries like Meepo or micro-heavy heroes like Chen, the roster supports every type of player. Learning a hero feels meaningful, and mastering one can take hundreds of games.  ✅ A Constantly Evolving Game Dota 2 is always changing. New heroes, major map reworks, balance patches, item overhauls, and gameplay systems continuously reshape how the game is played. These updates don’t just tweak numbers—they fundamentally alter strategies, metas, and priorities. This constant evolution keeps the game fresh but also ensures that even veteran players must adapt and relearn.  ✅ Incredible Competitive Integrity There is no pay-to-win here. Every hero is available to every player from the start. Victory is earned purely through skill, knowledge, teamwork, and execution. When you win, it feels deserved. When you lose, you know exactly where you failed. Few games deliver this level of competitive purity.  ✅ Sound Design and Clarity Dota 2’s sound design plays a huge role in gameplay. Spell audio cues, announcer lines, hero voice acting, and ability effects provide critical information during chaotic fights. The iconic announcer, hero taunts, and environmental sounds give the game personality without sacrificing clarity. The soundtrack and audio effects elevate tension during big moments, especially in late-game team fights.  ✅ The Esports Legacy Dota 2’s competitive scene is legendary. The International remains one of the most prestigious esports tournaments ever created, with unforgettable moments that have shaped gaming history. Even for casual players, watching high-level Dota can be inspiring and educational, showcasing the game at its absolute peak.  What Could Be Better? ❌ Extremely Harsh Learning Curve Dota 2 is one of the hardest multiplayer games to learn. There are countless mechanics—denying, creep equilibrium, vision control, item timing, power spikes—that the game does not properly teach. New players can feel completely lost for dozens of hours. This barrier to entry is one of the biggest reasons many players quit early.  ❌ Toxicity and Mental Pressure Because Dota 2 is so team-dependent, frustration can boil over quickly. Toxic behavior, blaming, and negativity are still common issues, especially in ranked play. A single mistake can snowball into a lost game, and not every teammate handles that pressure well. Playing Dota 2 requires not just skill, but mental resilience.  ❌ Long Match Commitment Matches can easily last 40–60 minutes, sometimes longer. Leaving is heavily punished, which means every game is a serious time investment. This makes Dota 2 less accessible for players who want quick or casual sessions.  ❌ Visual Clutter in Late Game While the visuals are strong, late-game team fights can become visually overwhelming. With dozens of spells, particles, and effects happening simultaneously, it can be difficult to track everything, especially for newer players.  Final Verdict ⭐ 9/10 – A Brutal, Brilliant Competitive Masterpiece ⭐ Dota 2 is one of the deepest, most demanding multiplayer games ever made. It rewards intelligence, teamwork, patience, and mastery like few others. Every victory feels earned, every loss teaches a lesson, and every match has the potential to become unforgettable. Its steep learning curve, toxicity, and time commitment make it inaccessible to some—but for players willing to invest, Dota 2 delivers an experience that no other MOBA can truly match. It’s stressful, exhilarating, frustrating, and addictive in equal measure. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge you mechanically, mentally, and emotionally—and keep evolving alongside you—Dota 2 remains one of the finest competitive games ever created.","baik"

"76561198268723427","Dota 2 is the real and spiritual successor to the original DotA map on Warcraft. There are so many online games around these days but Dota 2 still shines hard because of what it is. At the cost of over-simplification, it is a 5v5 bloody brawl that may be considered as a mix of soccer and chess    Dota 2 is an everything game. From long-term strategy to fast paced action, it has little bit of everything. The best part is that it is a team game that has literally infinite replayability. I have been playing this game since the time of Warcraft.    Though all the credits to Valve for keeping Dota 2 as it is and not infesting with pay to win mechanics, lot of people these days do not know about IceFrog. He is the original creator of this game. Since he does not wish his identity to be disclosed, it is surrounded with a shroud of secrecy.    But have no mistake, Dota 2 is an extremely brutal game and is not for the faint hearted. Casual players often get frustrated because of its team game mechanics. Out of five people in your team, even if one player is a bad apple, the whole team has to pay the price. There are toxic people as well but such is the case with every game. I can confidently say that Dota 2 is one of the least toxic games available in the market.    If you want a game that you can play for the rest of your life and never get bored, Dota 2 certainly tops the chart. The MOBA genre has other games too like League of Legends that are immensely popular but I feel the pristine nature of Dota 2 is unmatched. League of Legends is a great game but it is nowhere close to Dota 2 when it comes to love for the gamers. There is not even a single pay to win mechanic since its inception. Steam, Gabe Newell and IceFrog deserve tremendous praise here.     I have worked with IceFrog as a beta tester during the time of DotA days. Sadly, my internet sucked back then and I could not continue to contribute. Now I am 37 years old, have hundreds of games in my Steam Library, but there is something truly magical about Dota 2 that makes me come back to it.    I may be wrong but GabeN once said that why do you need any other game when there is Dota 2. He is not far from truth when he says that. Once you cross the initial threshold, it is easy to be hooked and then there is no looking back. The game also has a profound impact on the personality of the players. It forces the players to think hard and also forces a certain level of cooperation. Sometimes it is not pleasant, but in the long term it is rewarding.     I used to play this game since my college days (two decades ago) and the friendship that I garnered through this game is also timeless like the game itself.    As I said, it is a magical game that is both fun and interesting even today. Thankfully, the graphics have scaled with time, so there is no twinge of anachronism.    Anybody fed up with the current state of gaming must try Dota 2.     Thanks Steam, GabeN and IceFrog!     11/10 game Dota 2 is. :-)","baik"

"76561199207864810","skill floor is very high but once u play around 100 games you start to enjoy the game, as a competitive player my enjoyment comes from improvement and understanding whats going on in order to fix my mistakes and improve my gameplay...there is a lot of information when u start the game and is overwhelming, ive played league of legend for 10+ years and in some ways i feel like dota offers things that league just cant and i find enjoyment in those things. I encourage  any league player to give dota 2 a good try and find the enjoyment im finding. Very different games and each one gives u a different type of dopamine.","baik"

"76561198333475785","Dota 2 is a great real time strategy, role playing game. It has loads of characters to choose from and I can play online without the greatest intenet connection. The characters keep the game dynamic and the developers are always tweaking things even though it's pretty much the same map and objective every time. Turbo mode is good fun, keeps games under half an hour rather than the normal version which can easily hit an hour a round. Like with any online game the players are generally very comnpetitive and the learning curve is particularly steep in Dota 2. I would suggest getting a feel for some of the more basic characters in bot games before hitting the online. I was lucky enough to have a friend walk me through things and a little background info is very helpful for game strategy particularly with items but the in-game tutorials are pretty decent. Don't bother with the plus unless you're seriously into the game or playing professionally. Big shout out to the developers, we can see how much effort you put into this baby on the regular. Cheers, keep it real.","baik"

"76561198022451651","Honestly Dota is probably the gold standard for a F2P game. The monetisation is purely optional and only cosmetic. Valve consistently keep the gameplay fresh with large updates that entirely change the game (E.G. Map changes, Facets, innate abilities, aghanims/shard upgrades, new heroes, neutral items). It's worth noting that no other MOBA has seen such huge changes. Valve genuinely are ahead of the curve and continue to innovate and build upon the traditional MOBA mechanics.  Typically someone will only have room for 1 MOBA in their life. The genre lends itself to ridiculous playtime and expects the player to spend 500 hours before they really get to take the training wheels off. Dota is no exception to this and the tutorial is barely useful...  That being said, if you really do want to get into MOBAs, Dota is the only correct answer. If you are good at Dota, you can be great at any of the competitors (LoL,  HoN, Smite, etc). This is the only MOBA worth investing your freetime into. It's also more rewarding as the barrier of entry into semi-pro is much easier (Battlecup matches).","baik"

Even when I’m tired or busy, I still feel the urge to queue. It slowly turns you into a no-life person without you realizing it.

"76561198147126685","Video Game Review     I played: Dota 2    It is developed by: Valve Inc.    It is published by: Valve Inc.    The platform the game is available on: Windows (TM) PC    The game is about: Myths and Legends of original and creative civilizations that battle for dominance. The combat system uses a generic RTS style top-down perspective. Gamers can select from a variety of tactical abilities that replenish over time or using items found on the map and status effects when the Gamer’s character is near a friendly shrine or house. The tutorial shown at the first stage of the in-game roadmap is very informative, explaining the game style for quick start entertainment that beginners right through to experts with straight forward ease-of-use. The Keyboard and Mouse controls are well mapped out so gamers can choose a variety of different configurations that simplify character movement, attacks, offense, and navigation around the map. The Audio is sensational and the Graphics are eye-wateringly beautiful. Rendered in 3D the SFX make a immersive experience in the Dota 2 world keeping me fixated on the screen.    My favourite part was: Exploring the map and having tasks to keep Ancient Apparition, an intelligent class  magical hero busy with a few surprising lethal outcasts independent of the character’s main rival. The agility Anti-mage has anatomical designs with their masculinity was cool.  All the heros look cool except for Bane and the Arc Hero that has electricity, which look like monsters. The animations in menus and during gameplay are cool too.    I did not like it when: I was missing the first person view along with the top-down view. But it is still a great game.

"76561198333707880","Dota 2 is a highly competitive multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that offers a deep and rewarding experience, especially for players who enjoy strategy and teamwork.  One of the things I like most about Dota 2 is its complexity and depth. With a large roster of heroes, each with unique abilities and playstyles, every match feels different. The game strongly rewards teamwork, communication, and long-term skill improvement. I also appreciate that all heroes are available for free, which makes the game fair and accessible to everyone. Visually, the game is well-polished, and regular updates help keep it fresh.  However, Dota 2 can be difficult for new players to get into. The learning curve is very steep, and the game mechanics can feel overwhelming at first. In addition, the competitive environment can sometimes be unfriendly, which may discourage beginners or casual players. Matches can also be quite long, requiring a significant time commitment.  Overall, I would recommend Dota 2 to players who enjoy challenging games and are willing to invest time into learning and improving. While it may not be ideal for everyone, especially newcomers to the genre, it is an excellent game for those who appreciate deep strategy and competitive gameplay.","baik"

"76561199849683093","Dota 2 is the digital equivalent of a knife fight in a bar where everyone’s drunk, nobody agrees on the rules, and somehow it’s been going on for over a decade. Launched by Valve in 2013 (after a beta rooted in the 2003 Warcraft III mod Defense of the Ancients), it’s a free-to-play MOBA that’s less a game and more a lifestyle for its diehards. You pick a hero, team up with four strangers (or friends you’ll hate by the end), and try to destroy the enemy’s base while screaming into your mic about wards. It’s chaotic, punishing, and one of the most rewarding games ever made if you’ve got the stomach for it. Let’s break it down with the same raw, slightly unhinged energy as a 2 a.m. pub match.","baik"

"76561198043144242","I really love Dota 2. I think I will always come back to this game just to hang out and play since I’m so familiar with the mechanics it feels like I don’t need to think a lot and is relaxing (I know that’s a wild thing to say about this game). If I was reviewing this on just gameplay then it’s a masterpiece the balance can be off but at my level it doesn’t really matter (I’m just that bad). My biggest issues with Dota come from the stuff around the gameplay so if you like just playing stop reading this and just download it and play. My first this is the loot boxes. I honestly don’t have a problem with them in almost any game as long as they don’t have pay to win mechanics, but here they bother me. The cost to open one of them is somehow more than some of the rarer items end up being a month after the boxes come out. 9 times out of 10 you’ll save yourself time and money by waiting a week and buying whatever set you wanted off the market for 30 cents even for legendary items. I know this doesn’t apply to every item but this isn’t CS:GO there are very few items that get anywhere near the price of a knife so by the time you open 30 boxes to get the rare you’ve already spent more than it’s worth. The second thing is the toxic nature of the players I’ll sorta skip over this one by saying there is a setting to mute the other team for every game…. Turn it on and just immediately mute toxic teammates.  You can still communicate with your team when they are muted so it won’t affect you much since they weren’t being helpful anyways. The last thing is the in game events. They used to have some great in game events but now it seems they either recycle or get lazy with events.  The events have gotten better somewhat lately but it’s a little sad to log in for Halloween and not really get much to chew on. I know this won’t really seem like a good criticism but the events are some of the highlights I remember and things that kept me playing at the start because being real it’s hard to get into a MOBA at the start.   These things are nitpicks in the end and the gameplay is still super fun and engaging.

I understand nerfs and am alright with my favourite hero being nerfed, but this specifically is not much of nerf, but more limits the item options.

"76561198421655895","Dota 2, Valve's free-to-play juggernaut, continues to dominate the MOBA genre over a decade after its 2013 release, hitting a staggering 1.29 million concurrent players in late 2025 – proof that timeless design trumps fleeting trends. With Patch 7.40 introducing Largo and fresh mechanics, the game feels more alive than ever, blending brutal strategy, endless depth, and rewarding chaos into what remains the best multiplayer experience available. design trumps fleeting trends. With Patch 7.40 introducing Largo and fresh mechanics, the game feels more alive than ever, blending brutal strategy, endless depth, and rewarding chaos into what remains the best multiplayer experience available. Gameplay: Infinite Depth and Replayability At its core, Dota 2 is a symphony of strategic brilliance. Over 120 heroes – each with unique abilities, items, and counters – demand mastery of macro play, micro decisions, and split-second adaptation. Matches unfold like epic chess games crossed with high-octane brawls: lane phases test farming and harass, mid-game ganks reward vision control, and teamfights hinge on perfect coordination. Recent updates like the Monster Hunter crossover add cosmetic flair and new pets, while core balance tweaks keep the meta fresh without alienating veterans. New players face a steep curve (as it should be in a true MOBA), but tutorials, Turbo mode, and bot matches ease the entry. Once hooked, you'll chase that perfect Roshan steal or 5-man ult combo for hours – it's addictive, punishing, and profoundly satisfying. Multiplayer and Esports: The Pinnacle of Competition Dota 2's ranked system shines with transparent MMR, no SBMM nonsense, and modes for every mood – from casual Turbo to Immortal grind. Pubs are chaotic fun high-level play reveals godlike reads and mechanical wizardry. The esports scene? Untouchable. The International (TI) remains gaming's grandest spectacle, with million-dollar prize pools and storylines that rival pro sports. In 2025, events like GOTF and Worlds hype keep the fire burning, drawing massive crowds. Valve's commitment to free updates – no paywalls, just pure content – cements its loyalty. Graphics, Sound, and Polish: Timeless Excellence Source 2 engine delivers stunning visuals that scale from potato PCs to RTX beasts – lush maps, fluid animations, and particle-heavy spells pop without taxing hardware. Sound design elevates everything: announcer calls hype kills, hero voices add personality (Invoker remains iconic), and the OST swells during climactic fights. It's polished to perfection, with zero pay-to-win cosmetics funding endless improvements. Dota 2 isn't just a game it's a lifestyle – frustrating, exhilarating, and eternally replayable. In 2025, amid flashy reboots, it stands as the gold standard MOBA, pulling peaks no ""new"" title can match. Download it free, dive in, and prepare to lose (and love) thousands of hours. 10/10 – The Best MOBA, Period.","baik"

There’s toxicity like in any other competitive game, and that’s the downside, but it’s nothing you can really avoid.

Every match feels unique because of its deep strategy, wide hero pool, and endless possibilities for teamwork and skill expression.

"76561199490580791","В мире видеоигр редко встречаются проекты, которые становятся не просто развлечением, а целой экосистемой, языком общения и полем для бесконечного самосовершенствования. Dota 2 от Valve — именно такой феномен. Это не та игра, в которую можно просто «зайти поиграть». Это вызов, приняв который, вы обретаете уникальное, глубокое и невероятно насыщенное хобби на тысячи часов. Первое, что поражает даже спустя годы — глубина и свобода. В Dota 2 нет «правильных» сборок или раз и навсегда заученных действий. 120+ уникальных героев, каждый со своей сложной механикой и историей, и сотни предметов создают пространство для творчества. Один и тот же герой можно собрать и играть кардинально разными способами: быть неуловимым ассасином, неубиваемым танком или командным лидером. Каждая игра — это новая головоломка, где нужно анализировать союзников и противников, адаптировать тактику на лету и находить нестандартные решения. Здесь нет потолка для мастерства: всегда есть чему учиться, будь то тонкости управления крипами, тайминг способностей или психология командного взаимодействи Второй столп величия Dota 2 — идеальный баланс между индивидуальным мастерством и командной игрой. Можно виртуозно владеть героем и выигрывать дуэли, но настоящая победа рождается только в слаженной «пятёрке». Момент, когда после 40 минут напряжённой борьбы ваша команда без слов синхронизируется, наносит идеальный комбо умений, выигрывает решающий бой и стремительно несётся к финальному трону противника, дарит ни с чем не сравнимое чувство катарсиса. Это чистейшая форма спортивного азарта, цифровой аналог футбольного гола на последней минуте финала. Нельзя не сказать о технческом исполнении. Dota 2 — бесплатная игра в полном смысле этого слова. Все герои открыты с самого начала, а вся монетизация построена на косметических предметах, которые не дают никаких игровых преимуществ. Это образец честной модели. Кроме того, игра служит эталоном оптимизации — она запустится даже на не самом новом железе, а сервис от Valve работает как швейцарские часы. Регулярные масштабные обновления полностью меняют мету, добавляя новых героев, предметы и даже перерабатывая карту, что постоянно освежает геймплей. Наконец, Dota 2 — это живая культура с легендарными турнирами, многомиллионными призовыми фондами (The International), армией талантливых стримеров, художников и мемоделов. Игра обросла собственной мифологией, шутками и традициями. Она учит не сдаваться (ведь даже в самом безнадёжном матче есть шанс на эпическое возвращение), мыслить стратегически, работать в команде и нести ответственность за свои решения. Dota 2 — это больше, чем MOBA. Это шахматы, умноженные на экшн, командный спорт и полёт творческой мысли одновременно. Она может быть суровой и требовательной, но щедро вознаграждает тех, кто готов погрузиться в её бездонную глубину. Это величайший и самый амбициозный проект в истории компьютерных игр, титанический труд сотен людей, создавших не просто игру, а целую вселенную возможностей. Десять лет спустя она по-прежнему не имеет себе равных.","baik"

"76561198259512117","My Dota story started back in 2004, when my mom bought me my first computer in high school. It came with Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos, and that eventually led me to local computer shops where I discovered The Frozen Throne and a custom map that changed everything: Defense of the Ancients.  From 2004 to 2015, I spent countless hours playing DotA 1. I don’t know the exact number, and honestly, it’s probably better that way.  Then came Dota 2.  Now it’s 2025, and Steam tells me I have 10,370.9 hours on record. That’s more than a year of my life, not counting all the years before it.  Dota has been with me as I grew up, through school, work, stress, victories, heartbreaks, and now into a new chapter: I’m about to become a father.  Because of that, this game hits differently now.  Dota taught me curiosity. It taught me to understand systems, mechanics, interactions. It taught me teamwork, both good and bad. It taught me how to stay calm (or pretend to) when everything goes wrong.  And honestly, I hope my children one day find their version of a game like this, something that sparks their curiosity, makes them think, teaches them teamwork, and gives them memories that last a lifetime.  From 2004 to 2025, from uncounted DotA 1 hours to 10,370.9 hours in Dota 2, this game is part of my story.  10/10. From Reign of Chaos to raising kids.","baik"

"76561199623495992","Dota 2 is one of those games that never really lets you go. I’ve been playing on and off for years, and even though I still consider myself “slow hands,” I keep coming back for more.  The game is incredibly challenging in all the best ways. Learning the huge roster of heroes, figuring out their abilities, and discovering new ways to play them is always exciting. There’s a real sense of progression—not just in skill, but in understanding the game itself.  One of my favorite things is how much time I get to spend with friends. Whether we’re celebrating a clean victory or laughing off a chaotic loss, those hours together are some of the best parts of the experience. And honestly, losing can be just as valuable as winning the game does a great job of teaching through every match.  Overall, despite my occasional long breaks and my not-so-fast reflexes, Dota 2 remains one of the games I enjoy the most. Hard to master, harder to quit—but absolutely worth playing.","baik"

"76561199153430912","🎮 Game Review: 7/10 PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR RANKING SYSTEM FOR THE LOVE OF THE PLAYERS  🔇 Muted Communication is Killing Teamwork This is a massive problem. If you try to talk strategy or make a complex call, the system instantly flags it as ""communication abuse"" and mutes you. The chat is too restricted. It makes every single match feel like a solo queue bot game with zero real communication. This destroys the entire idea of a strategic team game. You can't coordinate when the game punishes you for trying to talk.  🏆 The Rank Grind is Unbearable The ranking (MMR) system is flat-out unfair and way too slow compared to every other MOBA.  The issue is getting stuck with people who share your rank medal but are clearly much worse. Other games let you climb fast and leave the bad players behind. Dota 2 locks you in. You have to win a huge number of games just to move up one Division but in the same rank. That's 750 MMR across five divisions. It forces experienced players to constantly carry low-skill teammates, making the whole rank climb feel like an endless, exhausting treadmill.  ✨ The Good Stuff Cosmetics are top-tier. They look incredible and are worth the money. I appreciate that you can still get some quality items for free or with in-game currency.  Optimization is perfect. You can genuinely play this game well, even on a weak, old laptop. It runs smooth.  ⚔️ Gameplay: Genius Idea, Broken Balance The core game is brilliant and easy to learn if you put in the time. The best part is how skills can be mixed and used in creative ways that no other game offers.  But is it balanced? Absolutely not.  The game has heroes that can abuse their skills because the drawbacks are too small. They have low mana costs and short cooldowns. They just spam abilities nonstop.  The whole game right now favors the ""Clicker Meta."" It's not about making smart, strategic plays anymore. It's about how fast you can click and execute actions. The game is basically rewarding high speed over smart decision-making, which is a letdown for a game this deep.","baik"

Every game is a new surprise! Either your kerry decides that his vocation is just to stand by the fountain, or the enemy team will so carefully tell you what exactly you are doing wrong in life.  I recommend it for masochists, linguists (learn countless new ways to combine swear words and genealogy) and those who have long dreamed of having their lives controlled by an invisible algorithm that captures your every mistake.  In general, the game is a real fire! It's just a blazing bonfire that burns your nerve cells.","baik"

"76561198078226905","DOTA 2: The Rabbit Hole of MOBAs  **Highly Recommended (With a mandatory, 1000-hour warning)**  Hours Played: 2000+  TLDR: Dota 2 is less a video game and more a full-time, competitive mental sport. It has an impossibly high skill ceiling, unparalleled strategic depth, and the most satisfying ""Aha!"" moments of any game I've played. You will be bad for hundreds of hours, your teammates will hate you, and you will learn to love it. It's free, but it will cost you your free time and sanity.  The Grind and the Glory  In Dota 2, two teams of five players clash, attempting to destroy the enemy's ""Ancient"" structure located within their base. Simple, right? Absolutely not.  The Complexity is the Hook: This game throws everything at you: 120+ unique heroes, each with four abilities and a talent tree a massive item shop with active and passive effects a huge map with specific jungle camps, two river runes, and multiple objectives (Roshan, Outposts). Learning the game is a marathon. The community joke is true: your first 1000 hours are the tutorial. The sheer amount of skill and game knowledge required to reach a competent level is daunting, but it means that when you pull off a perfect Black Hole or a five-man Chronosphere, the feeling is pure, earned godhood.  The Gameplay is Unforgiving: There is no room for mistakes. A single misclick, a misplaced ward, or a poorly timed ability can instantly swing a fight, or even the entire game. Unlike other MOBAs, Dota 2's complexity—from denying creep experience to the deep mechanics of Gold and XP advantage—means that snowballing can be brutal. This high-stakes environment means every game feels competitive, even in low ranks.  Team Play, Toxic or Triumphant: Since it's 5v5, team player synergy is everything. You need coordination, communication (often via pings or chat wheels, thank god), and an understanding of your team's composition. When five strangers click and execute a perfect strategy, it's magical. When they don't? Well, the community can be famously toxic. You'll definitely want a mute button handy, but the competitive fire is part of the appeal.  The Verdict  Dota 2 is a beautiful beast. It’s a constant puzzle that rewards deep investment. If you are looking for a game to casually pick up for 30 minutes, go play something else. If you are looking for a competitive sink where you can forever measure your improvement and enjoy a truly deep, complex strategic experience, you've found your home.  Be ready to suffer, be ready to learn, and be ready to never uninstall it.","baik"

"76561198827189569","I launched Dota 2 expecting a relaxing gaming session. What I got instead was a full-scale emotional demolition simulator certified by the universe itself. My first match didn’t just feel long — I’m pretty sure entire civilizations rose and fell while I tried to last-hit under tower.  Somewhere between being yelled at for picking the “wrong hero” and being politely informed that I have “the map awareness of a potato,” I felt my spirit leave my body for a brief vacation. By minute 25, I had unlocked new physical conditions: stress-induced aging, phantom keyboard pain, and mild PTSD triggered by the word “mid?”.  My offlaner blamed me for global warming, my carry told me I was the reason humanity can’t progress, and the enemy Spirit Breaker charged me from so far away I think he started in another timeline.  When it was finally over, I stared at my monitor, reconsidered every life choice that led me here, and accepted that joy is a myth. 10/10 — would emotionally collapse again.

"76561199837104128","Dota 2 is not just a game. It is a long-term relationship with disappointment. A journey through chaos, betrayal, hope, existential crisis, emotional damage, and the occasional win you absolutely did not deserve.  It starts beautiful. It ends tragic. In the middle is just… pain.  You open Dota feeling fresh. Maybe today you climb. Maybe you get good teammates. Maybe, just maybe, matchmaking doesn’t hate you.  Wrong.  Instantly:  Someone insta-locks Sniper: “mid or feed”  Carry picks Anti-Mage with 0 hours played  Offlaner picks Techies and proudly announces: “Я В ЛЕС.” (“I jungle.”)  Great start.  The game loads. Creeps walk. Birds sing. Everything seems peaceful.  Until Pudge hooks a neutral creep from another dimension and your support buys smoke instead of wards because “vision is a government conspiracy.”  At some point, a Russian player joins the match. And everything changes.  Mic turns on: Static. Hardbass. Then the battle cry:  «ДАВАЙ НАХУЙ, ИГРАЕМ!»  And the craziest part? You understand him. Perfectly.  You didn’t study Russian. You didn’t take classes. Dota taught you. Pain taught you. Slavic teammates shaped you.  Now you know Russian callouts like a native.  🎤 Voice chat chaos includes:  «ОЙ БЛИН!» — someone messed up  «КУДА ТЫ ЛЕЗЕШЬ, БРАТ!?» — stop diving  «ИГРАЙ НОРМАЛЬНО!» — nobody is playing normally  «ВСЁ, Я ФАРМЛЮ.» — they’re abandoning the team  «НЕ ОРЫ НА МЕНЯ!» — said while screaming  «ЩА ПОКАЖУ» — dangerous, unpredictable event coming  And you understand all of it like you have a Slavic soul.  💬 Text chat chaos:  “???”  “lag”  “mid diff”  “report team”  “я соло”  “GG минута 3”  “нормально играем!!!”  🔔 Pings:  Every Russian ping hits harder than a global ability. One ping = disappointment. Ten pings = hatred. Fifty pings = spiritual message.  Someone dies? PING PING PING PING PING PING.  Enemy missing? Your midlaner pings the whole map like a malfunctioning nuclear alarm.  🧘 When the Russian carry goes silent:  This is worse than flaming.  No chat. No pings. No movement.  You know he is angry. You know disaster is near.  Found later: Trying to solo Roshan with Brown Boots and 40 HP.  Beautiful. Tragic. Slavic.  Every teamfight is a masterpiece of chaos:  Axe blinks and ults a creep  Pudge hooks YOU and screams: «БЛИН!»  Invoker forgets half his abilities  Dazzle Graves himself at 100% HP  Juggernaut spins directly into the fountain  Enigma channels Black Hole… …and a random creep cancels it by looking at him crooked  Meanwhile your carry is in the jungle:  «НЕ ФАЙТЬТЕСЬ, Я ФАРМЛЮ!»  Team wipes. Carry dies to neutral camp. Classic.  📉 STRATEGY — THE ART OF DELUSION  You try to make a plan:  You: “Let’s push mid.”  Carry: «300 голды надо»  Support: «вард пж»  Mid: “split”  Offlaner: “wait bkb”  Techies: detonating mines in Africa  After 10 minutes of “planning,” everyone runs in different directions and dies one by one like confused chickens.  Your team is losing. Everything looks doomed.  But then… A miracle.  One accidental fight goes well because the enemy walked uphill blind or forgot their keyboard.  Suddenly:  “We can win this!” “Don’t throw!” “Late game we scale.” You do not scale.  Then your carry buys Divine Rapier, has 100 HP, walks into river, trips, dies, and gifts it to the enemy PA.  GG.  Hope deleted.   After 60 minutes of chaos, flaming, screaming, hardbass, emotional damage, 300 pings, and a support with 4k damage, the game ends.  Win or lose doesn’t matter.  Your brain whispers:  “One more.”  And you obey.  You queue again. You suffer again. You learn more Russian.  Now you understand:  insults  motivation  complaints  threats  tactical commands  spiritual screaming  and the entire Slavic emotional spectrum  All thanks to Dota 2.  🏆 FINAL VERDICT  Dota 2 is:  pain  chaos  therapy and trauma together  Russian screaming  the birthplace of pings, madness, and broken keyboards  and the only game that gives you a free Russian language course  10/10 — ruind my sleep schedule, mental stability, and MMR again.

It’s punishing, complex, and sometimes frustrating—but when everything clicks, it delivers some of the most exhilarating moments you’ll ever experience in gaming. If you’re willing to invest the time, it will reward you with endless depth and unforgettable battles.","baik"

"76561198439855426","Dota 2 is one of those games that genuinely makes me question my life choices. Every time I open it, a small part of me whispers, “You don’t have to do this,” and yet my brain hits Play Dota anyway. Thousands of hours in, thousands of regrets later, here I am, willingly returning to the digital torture chamber.  From the moment a match starts, Dota 2 reminds you that you do not understand this game — and you probably never will. With 126 heroes, each packed with enough mechanics, interactions, and patch notes to require a PhD, the game expects you to absorb information at a rate normally reserved for quantum physicists. You might master a handful of heroes, sure, but the rest will continue to ruin your games in ways both creative and spiritually devastating.  And the matches themselves? Pure chaos… in the most beautiful way possible.  One minute you pull off the perfect combo, outplay your opponents, and feel like a tactical genius. Five minutes later, your carry queues Midas at minute 35, your support jungles, someone buys four Divine Rapiers “for morale,” and suddenly you’re defending Ancient alone while questioning everything.  Dota 2 is brilliant, painful, exhilarating, exhausting. A masterpiece that despises you. And I hate it right back.  But beneath all that chaos and emotional trauma, Dota 2 remains one of the deepest, most rewarding competitive games ever made. For every crushing defeat, there’s a match that reminds you why this game has refused to die for over a decade. And so the cycle continues.  Personal scores:  Gameplay Depth: 10/10 (a bottomless pit of mechanics you’ll never fully understand) Hero Variety: 10/10 (126 heroes = 126 ways to win and 126 ways to destroy your own team) Community Experience: 3/10 (ranges from philosophical geniuses to war criminals) Learning Curve: 2/10 (vertical, slippery, and actively hostile) Match Quality: 7/10 (a mix of peak gaming and psychological suffering) Tilt Factor: 11/10 (unofficial stat but 100% accurate)  Overall: 8.5/10 — A legendary, miserable, hilariously painful game I hate… yet I keep coming back like it’s a lifestyle.","baik"

The hero roster is vast and diverse, with each character offering unique abilities, synergies, and counterplay.

The constantly shifting meta keeps gameplay fresh, ensuring no two matches ever feel the same.  Teamwork is essential.

This game also had one of the largest and best updates I've ever seen in a multiplayer game with the map expansion update.  This game is ""hard"" to get into, but I do think it's worth it, after you get the basics it can be a very chill game to play casually, in the way that it's not a fast paced high adrenaline twitch shooting reaction based game maybe some character can feel like that, but the game is mainly a cerebral game. Most of that mental work is done at the start as it becomes muscle memory after enough time and you don't even need to think about it.

"76561198143535423","⭐ Dota 2 – Game Review  Platform: PC Genre: MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) Developer: Valve Release: 2013 (continuously updated)  🎮 Gameplay  Dota 2 is a deep, highly strategic 5v5 competitive game where teams fight to destroy the enemy Ancient. With over 120 unique heroes, item builds, talents, and complex mechanics, it offers endless replayability. Every match feels different because heroes interact in surprising ways, and teamwork is often the deciding factor.  The learning curve is infamously steep. New players often struggle with last-hitting, map awareness, and advanced mechanics like creep aggro or power runes. But once those click, the game becomes incredibly satisfying.  ⭐ What Dota 2 Does Exceptionally Well 1. Unmatched Depth & Complexity  It’s widely considered the most mechanically and strategically complex MOBA. No match feels scripted you constantly adapt.  2. High Skill Ceiling  Veterans love that mastery takes years. Knowledge matters as much as mechanics.  3. Beautiful, Polished Visuals  Valve’s Source 2 engine gives smooth animations, readable effects, and a clean UI.  4. Free-to-Play Done Right  Every hero is free. No pay-to-win. Cosmetic-only monetization (skins, couriers, terrain, etc.).  5. Massive eSports Scene  The International remains one of the biggest prize pool events in gaming. Watching pro matches is an experience itself.  ⚠️ Weaknesses 1. Very Steep Learning Curve  New players may feel overwhelmed and sometimes frustrated.  2. Toxicity  Team-based games + high stakes = sometimes rough player interactions.  3. Long Match Times  Matches last 30–60 minutes. No quick-play mode.  4. Balance Swings  Frequent patches keep the game fresh, but can make some heroes feel unbalanced.  🗺️ Community Experience  The player base is passionate and experienced, but sometimes intense. Dota 2 is best enjoyed with friends or a consistent group to reduce toxic encounters.  🏆 Overall Verdict  9/10 – A masterpiece of competitive gaming, but not for the faint of heart.  If you enjoy deeply strategic, team-based games with a high skill ceiling, Dota 2 is one of the most rewarding multiplayer titles ever made. If you prefer simpler or more relaxed gameplay, it may feel overwhelming.","baik"
"76561198036385985","Truly a great game. A lot of people say it's very difficult (which it is) but it's also a great game to play casually. There are in game guides that help new players just play the game instead of worrying about itemization.

"76561198331988749","Dota 2 is a cesspool where cheaters and whiners feel right at home. 1 out of 10 stars  If you're looking for hell but don't want to leave the comfort of your computer, welcome to Dota 2. This game has long since become less a contest of skill and more a competition of who has the best software and the strongest nerves.  Cheaters are the new masters of the cesspool.  Every other game is a lottery. Will your team win? No. The question is which side will have the player with the perfect Pudge hook prediction, who always knows where you stand in the fog of war, and whose couriers deliver items themselves. Scripts for instant disables, autocasts, and a map that shows all enemies are not rare exceptions, but the harsh reality.  Whiners are the soundtrack to the cesspool.  You've just logged into the game, and your mid laner has already died twice and is typing ""gg"" in the chat. Someone picked the wrong hero, someone didn't like your build, someone simply decided the game was already lost five minutes in. The entire match is a symphony of ping spam, insults in voice chat, and passive-aggressive text messages. Teamwork for victory? There's no such thing. There are five people, each convinced they're the lone genius on a team of asses, and everyone must obey them.  Bottom line:  Dota 2 is a digital cesspool where the developers can't (or won't) clean it up. It eats up your time and nerves, offering nothing in return except frustration and a scorched emotional wasteland. It's better to download another game, reread a book, or just stare at the wall. It'll be more productive and enjoyable.","baik"

"76561198105574266","Dota 2 currently has a significant prevalence of smurf accounts. Newly created accounts have become the preferred choice for smurfs, particularly those using nicknames with Chinese characters. Furthermore, several in-game features have not been updated, such as the Dota Plus quests and certain hero talents that are considered ineffective. A prime example is Crystal Maiden's talent that provides +225 attack speed.  Additionally, the process for reporting smurf accounts is notably slow, which contributes to the high number of smurfs in the game. This situation has made the game feel increasingly unfair and has diminished its overall enjoyment since the rise of smurfing.","buruk"
"76561199096229138","The game punishes new players. The lower your behavior score drops, the worse the people you are matched with. Anytime other players report you, even if its just for being inexperienced, you lose behavior points. The lower behavior points the other players have, the more they like to report. Its a never ending cycle where new players are stuck. I am new to games like this, and while I have begun to enjoy Dota for the gameplay, I am not the best at it. Even with over 100 hours I am still not the most talented player. The game makes you start out playing with random players of all ranks and skillsets so you are often matched with and against people who know more than you. Some are helpful and understanding, most are incredibly testy. They get angry over small mistakes, cuss, and rally others to start a reporting parade. If Dota changes their social credit system so it actually punishes people who are trolling, insulting, and abusing the game instead of punishing learning curves and the infrequent spotty internet error, I would recommend this game to most people.","buruk"

He literally was raging all game, he went 0-15, and he was mashing the report button on all team for everything. Saw him playing games the next few days. So for sure the behavior system is a good idea. So don't waste your time with this game. You will just rage and not enjoy anything. You get 200 behavior points for 15 games with commends and one conviction you get penalized with 1000 point, EVEN IF YOU DON'T write anything you don't ping nothing.

"76561198120223786","Negative Review of Dota 2    Dota 2 is one of the most overrated and toxic games I have ever encountered. Despite years of existence and Valve’s enormous resources, the game remains incredibly frustrating, mentally exhausting, and often unfair in every possible way.    1. Terrible Community  One of the main reasons people quit Dota 2 is its community. It is truly toxic: in almost every game, there is at least one player who either deliberately ruins the match or insults the entire team. The report system is practically useless—griefers and toxic players go unpunished, while you can get muted just for asking your team to play cooperatively.    2. Extremely High Learning Curve  Even if you want to learn the game, are willing to invest time, and try to understand the mechanics, Dota 2 doesn’t make it easy for you. There is no proper tutorial, and the sheer amount of information you need to memorize is overwhelming. Moreover, even if you become a skilled player, that doesn’t mean you’ll win—too much depends on teammates and pure luck.    3. Balance is a Myth  Heroes are either too strong or completely useless. Every patch shifts the meta so drastically that you have to relearn everything. Some heroes stay unplayable for months, making it pointless to invest time mastering them, as they may become irrelevant in just a couple of updates.    4. Matchmaking is a Lottery  The ranking system in Dota 2 is another source of frustration. Matchmaking works in such a way that sometimes you get a team that plays perfectly, and sometimes you get players who have no understanding of the game’s basics. There is no balance between teams, and your wins or losses are more dependent on luck than skill.    5. A Waste of Time  To make any real progress, you need to invest hundreds of hours, yet even after that, you won’t necessarily enjoy the game. Every match is either stressful or disappointing, and the feeling of satisfaction is extremely rare.    Conclusion  Dota 2 may seem interesting at first, but in reality, it drains your time, nerves, and energy. It is a game for those who are willing to endure toxicity, unbalanced mechanics, and frustration. If you’re looking for fun, it’s best to stay far away from this chaos.","buruk"

The draw to this piece of shit is unlike anything I've felt in this life. Nothing can compare to the shear dread and misery that becomes of my soul when I click that green play button. Every game, even the ones I win, are pure dogshit and fuckage. The absolute depression that falls upon me when the enemy shits on me at every turn is maddening. The only feeling of ecstasy this game brings to me is when the enemy pushes my Ancient and ends the game, and thus, my suffering. The Fact I have spent a total of 66 full days of my life in this shithole is a testament to my ability to control my impulses. I can never recommend this game to anyone unless they want to spend hours upon hours of their dick getting stepped on with cleats. Pure and utter misery, beginning to end.

"76561199189051136","The Most Miserable Masterpiece Ever Made    Dota 2: The Most Miserable Masterpiece Ever Made    Dota 2 is less of a game and more of an elaborate psychological torture chamber disguised as entertainment. It’s a 5v5 strategy MOBA where, in theory, you pick heroes, farm gold, destroy towers, and eventually the enemy Ancient. In practice, you spend most of your time questioning your life choices while being insulted by strangers from six different countries simultaneously.    Gameplay – or why fun is illegal  The game is technically deep — 124 heroes, hundreds of items, thousands of possible interactions. But here’s the catch: it’s only fun for the first 0.01% of players who have mastered every single mechanic. For everyone else, it’s a constant state of being too weak to matter or too dead to play. Matches last an average of 35–50 minutes, which sounds fine until you realize you can lose in the first five and still be forced to sit there for the rest of the match pretending you have hope.    The Learning Curve – shaped like a cliff  Most games ease you in. Dota 2 hands you a rope, tells you to climb, and then sets the rope on fire. The tutorial teaches you how to move and buy a single item — then drops you into games where you’re expected to instantly understand last-hitting, creep aggro, stacking camps, ward placement, map awareness, item timing, power spikes, counterpicks, and at least 20 hero-specific mechanics.    The Community – a global anthology of toxicity  If the United Nations wanted a case study in human hostility, Dota 2’s voice chat logs would be the first thing they open. Teammates will flame you for playing badly, for playing well, for picking the wrong hero, or for existing at all. You’ll get blamed for losses you didn’t cause and rarely thanked for wins you carried. Mute buttons exist, but that only stops the words — the ping spam will still haunt you.    Matchmaking – where dreams go to die  Valve’s matchmaker feels like it was coded by a dice-rolling raccoon. One game you’ll have coordinated teammates, the next you’ll have someone who just discovered WASD. There’s nothing like getting matched with a first-time player on Techies when you’re up against a 6,000 MMR stack.    The Meta – a constantly shifting nightmare  Every patch flips the entire game upside down. One month your favorite hero is an unstoppable powerhouse, the next they feel like a wet noodle. Learn one strategy? Too bad — it’s obsolete by the next Tuesday.    Graphics & Sound – fine, but irrelevant  Yes, the game looks good. Yes, the sound design is sharp. But when you’re on a 50-second death timer because you got one-shot by a hero you didn’t even see on your screen, you won’t care about the pretty trees or the satisfying crit sound.    The Addiction Loop – your worst habit in disguise  The most diabolical part of Dota 2 is that it keeps tricking you into coming back. You’ll swear you’re done after a soul-crushing loss, but then you think, “One more game. I can win this time.” Then it’s 3 AM, your eyes hurt, and you’ve gained nothing but a deeper sense of regret.    Conclusion – a perfectly balanced disaster  Dota 2 is a masterclass in game design and a masterclass in ruining your mood. It’s the kind of game that can give you the best match of your life and the worst match of your life in the same evening. If you value your sanity, your free time, or your blood pressure, stay away. If you do play, you’ve either accepted the suffering… or you’re too far gone to notice anymore.    Final Score: 2/10 — “Technically brilliant, emotionally bankrupt.","buruk"

In actuality this Game is a toxic slump full of smurfs. The new player experience is getting destroyed for hundreds of hours and it's rare they can play a game with people of their skill level.     You have high elo players destroying low elo games all the time and it's ridiculous nothing is done about this. Of course you have a 6 sloted Carry in a Herald or Crusader game after 30 minutes. Of course you have a midlaner going 20/0/20 all the time.    Unless Valve do something about all of this, you should absolutely stay away from Dota at all costs or you will suffer.","buruk"

"76561199066939221","I have never played a game less friendly towards beginners than this. As much as I want to learn to play it I don't feel like spending hundreds of hours studying every hero and their abilities just to end up being deleted by a person who has played hundred times longer than you while simultaneously being told to end my days in a language I couldn't understand until starting this game. Everything is overwhelming and you don't have time to figure anything out before being thrown into a game. There doesn't seem to be a way to queue for a specific role or if there is I'm too stupid to find it so when you get in a game you have no idea which role you are expected to play while also some of the heroes not being available to you despite them being an option in ""new player mode"" (for example Muerta). There are so many features and the game is incredibly complex, but almost none of it is explained so you end up watching hours of tutorials to get the most basic grasp on it.   I prefer the overall design to LoL and would much rather play this one over it, but I feel like the only way to get into it as a new person is to have a friend who has played it for years and can teach you while playing with you.    My internet disconnected for a few seconds while playing and after rejoining the match, nothing seemed to move despite waiting for a couple of minutes. Only thing that helped was closing the entire game and restarting it to be able to join that match and afterwards I was given a punishment for ""abandoning"" the game. On paper this game is incredible, but the experience of being thrown into a match as a new player with only seconds to make all the decisions needed is so horrible that I am seriously considering downloading League again despite being cancer-free for a few years now.","buruk"

"76561198027808762","This guy is spot on. He only has 15k hours because he fell into the trap like countless others and many more will in the future.  The game is literally designed to create addiction and fuel their monthly battle pass subscription service. Hackers run rampant and if you somehow overcome the odds and begin to win, the game studies you, adapts, and then overcomes you.  How does it overcome you? Many ways, let's name a few: Opponents cheat, your team are bots, you play on ""North America"" server but all your team are from foreign lands speaking everything but English, your team are toxic/griefers, the mmr is hidden and pairs you with wide ""skill"" gap teammates vs Seal Team 6.  Let's examine some red flags: The worst and best players in dota vary in winrate from 46 percent to 54 percent until you hit your ""true"" mmr!  Watch people use their ""mmr"" as some kind of badge or medal defining their worth while seamlessly making plays worse than any ""Herald"" low rank player you've ever seen. Be a scientist and run an experiment: Spend money and watch your ""winrate"" suddenly go up!  Still not convinced? Watch your favorite streamers get secret algorithm boosts from the developers so they can ""win"" but we all know if they were in the matches you face on your account, even the ""pros"" couldn't win. Doubt me? Tell me how you win when your team runs down middle and feeds as soon as they respawn because you didn't play the way ""they want"" or because they lost their last game and now you must suffer 2 or you defeated them in the previous game and now they will make sure you lose.  Let's find a solution! Simply put them on your avoid list right? But wait! You are limited on the amount of ""avoid"" slots even with the subscription service.  How about mute your team? Enjoy playing a ""team game"" requiring communication on silent mode.  How about communicate with your team? Watch them mute you faster than you can say ""Cash or Credit.""   ""Free To Play"" has and always will be a keyword for ""Pay To Win"" and ""Hackers Paradise"".  Even ""pro teams"" can't beat ""AI"" artificial intelligence.  Look up ""Open AI defeats OG"" on youtube from 6 years ago for any ""haters"" or ""doubters"" of what I'm saying. Better yet, look up ""Dota 2 Tips hackers"" and you will find a plethora of dota 2 cheats and cheaters.  For the longest time people ran with the mantle of ""hacks don't exist"" in dota or ""it's about skill"" while they ""360 headshot"" you and laugh. Anyone still remember ""Liver King Claims To Be Natty""? Or how about Clintons ""I did not sleep with that woman! Ms. Lewinski!"".  The developers don't care about any of us, simply about making money. The game was never about skill or any other ""keywords"" they use to trigger you with. It was and always will be simply a source of endless revenue for a company ""Valve"" that simply doesn't care but they can and will keep you coming back because ""things are different now"".  They know we can't stop them and they can and will continue to treat us like the cash cows we are. This game owes you nothing but they can and will steal everything from you if you let them.  When you get called an idiot in dota or any other game just take a deep breathe and imagine the anonymous idiot behind a computer screen being a keyboard warrior with his paid actor ""friends"" ganging up on you because they don't want to be the next target.  One look at your President of Valve Corporation ""Lord Gaben"" or his ""net worth"" should tell you all you need to know about ""Valve"" and their so called ""ethics"".  If you get on his nice list maybe he will even give you an ""Immortal"" high rank account for free so you 2 can look and act like a ""pro"" 2.  If you read nothing else just do this: Find a guy/girl you like and tell them how important a video game called ""Dota 2"" is to you and how much time you've ""invested"". When they leave you proceed to ask them back by telling them how big your ""mmr"" is. See if it works and get back to me. Have a great day! :steamsalty::steamthumbsup:","buruk"

The lack of a ""surrender"" option further worsens this issue, forcing you to spend upwards of an hour playing a losing game that was decided in the first five minutes. ""Get good"" does not apply here when the games are outright rigged. How are you supposed to turn games around when three of your teammates are feeding 0:10 and your opponent is at 10:0 at 10 mins?

Sure, the tutorials cover the basics, but they feel very incomplete and out of touch compared to the core things a player should know about dota.    Performance gets worse every year, requiring costlier PC and higher electricity bill. All that just to play the same game that used to run perfectly on a laptop powered by a phone charger 10 years ago.    If you really like dota's gameplay and have a modern PC, then it's possible to enjoy the game like I do.

What I mean is nobody seems to care about winning anymore.   This is a complex game. It requires brainpower, thinking, and focus. It’s like chess.

So I tested it out and didn't speak, text, or type a couple of games Guess what>? my score still went down for communication. How!!!?? Many of the games we won and I carried to victory without saying a word but some how still got reported.

Definitely don't play this game if you value your time because the amount of mechanics that exist just to prevent you from ending the game to queue the next one are insane, there is no surrender option and the community loves that.   They are a bunch of extremely toxic (mostly Russian) idiots who start yelling on the mic at you and that also doesn't help the fact that you have to share a team with these guys for the next potential 60 minutes of your time.   There is depth to this game, for sure, but at the same time nothing really prevents you from 5 manning everywhere in lower mmr and winning for free, at least that's my experience   Anyways don't play this stupid thing if you like being happy, because it is a sure thing that you will not be playing this, just boot up League honestly, one game lasts 15 to 20 minutes and off you go.  That reminds me that people also pause this game in the middle of everything just to go about their business, for example they have to feed their dog or take a dump, and will act like you are the unreasonable one for not wanting to wait for them, crazy  ","buruk"

"76561199261524308","I used to love this game, I've been playing since the original DOTA (on Warcraft 3 [Custom Game]). However, recently the game has become substantially worse, rife with toxic behavior from people who believe they know how to play the game, but unfortunately do not. Recently, I've had people curse me out calling me every name under the sun, simply for correcting them about a mistake they made with regards to the rules of making a report, or how the game is traditionally played. Sometimes the players will just shut down completely, (I'm being cordial and kind the entire time, mind you.) so they start talking over me every time I try to talk, not letting me get a word in edgewise. At that point I may simply call them a ""noob"" they report me and then somehow I get my behavior score lowered, even though they were the one harassing me and going utterly ballistic in the first place. I find this to be completely ridiculous. Most people cannot take constructive criticism or advice in this game, they almost ALWAYS take it personally. Also, there are some EXTREME imbalances in the game, where characters such as Warlock, Windranger, and Juggernaught can simply plow through nearly an entire team by themselves, due to their outrageously overpowered ultimate abilities. This game needs some SERIOUS reworking.  As if all of that wasn't bad enough, There is a disconnect on nearly 2/3 games now, meaning you typically have to start at least 3 different games just to get one that you may be actually be able to play through to the finish, without someone disconnecting. I've even disconnected several times myself, and I know that it's not my internet causing the issue because I haven't disconnected from the internet at all. This has become a constant. I used to be able to recommend this game, but I certainly no longer can for these reasons.","buruk"

Players should be mandated to take a communication course before being allowed to play ranked games, but instead Valve allows this toxic community to flourish and the innocent receive vindictive reports and banishment.

"76561198324023045","Dota is the single greatest video game of all time in my opinion but Valve has ruined it by refusing to update the game in any meaningful way. The only updates we get are AI slop updates that give minor tweaks to heroes like +5 move speed -1 armor or cosmetic slop patches like the most recent one. These patches are essentially humiliation rituals for Dota lifers. Valve is clearly more interested in making more shitty failure games like Artifact instead of allocating more resources into improving an already proven game and e-sport. League of legends has like 180 heroes and Dota only has about 120.

"76561198042292732","I've played dota on and off for almost 20 years. In my opinion it is the greatest game of all time. Over the years there has been few things in my life that itch like dota. Waking up and just knowing i needed to play a pudge game or storm. The frontier patch was the bell heralding the end of my dota journey. I want to say thanks for everyone who worked on dota and brought it to the world.   I used to believe dota was a skillset. something I could build and use throughout my life. The energy to get better. The time invested reading patch notes and experimenting with mechanics. Learning each and every crevice of the map so i could juke or make a play wherever i was. As I get older, Dota gets faster. what used to be a real time strategy game seems to be moving more to a league of legends type of game. Having a great mind for dota has never been less valuable. As a low immortal I was around 400 wins averaging 25 mmr per win from the top end of immortal. If I could maintain a 60% winrate it would take me 2000 games to reach 15k mmr. in the time it would take to play those games the game will change drastically likely multiple times. New cracked op heroes will dominate the meta for months at a time. The game will get faster,   and my 20 years experience will become irrelevant, or worse detrimental.   Dota wasnt a game that needed *fixing*. I understand that popularity is the only metric most game designers care about now a days. But it was a deeply flawed concept that you could simply mirror league of legends design philosophy having rotations of heroes being OP instead of aiming for balance. Dota shouldnt be an APM check either. it should be strategy and execution.    If Dota was slower (Lower the amount of things you can accomplish in 60 seconds). If I didnt have to worry about the next frontier patch. If Dota was being designed for balance. If New heroes were designed as less is more. If the game design philosophy of league and fortnite had never taken root in Dota. I would still be playing. And I could recommend this game to other players.  Dota with its current team of no doubt all star industry game designers perhaps might bring Dota into a new golden age of popularity. But I will sadly not being playing.

In other words - not deal with the huge skill unbalance that exists in Turbo match making.  Note to devs - no one wants to play normal style, anymore. The base favors quick and casual games.

Pros    + The highest highs you will ever feel gaming  Pulling off a game-winning Black Hole, landing a 5-man Ravage, or timing that perfect Echo Slam — the dopamine is illegal. When a coordinated team play comes together, you ascend spiritually.    + Infinite skill ceiling  8,803 hours in and I still learn something new. A new ward spot, a new timing, a new way to throw the game. This thing is a never-ending education in pain and improvement. Only DotA lets you feel both genius and clown in the same match.    + The hero diversity and depth is absurd  Every patch feels like learning a new game. 125+ heroes, item reworks, map changes — you can’t ever fully master it. And that’s the beauty. DotA is alive, unpredictable, chaotic, and brilliant.    + Teamplay that (sometimes) feels like symphony  A coordinated 5-man smoke gank is art. A well-timed Save? Poetry.

I could’ve learned a language. I could’ve built a house. Instead I warded highgrounds and argued with strangers about support items.    – Teamwork is a myth most days  For every beautiful game, there are fifty where your mid buys Midas into a losing lane and your carry farms jungle minute 48. Matchmaking is where hope goes to die.    – Tilt is not a feeling — it’s a lifestyle  You can win five in a row, feel like God, then one stomped match will destroy your entire sense of identity.

"76561198807451021","This is one of the strongest games available if you enjoy theorycrafting and want a real-time strategic RPG-style PvP experience without the mechanical burden of managing large numbers of units, as in traditional RTS games.  However, the solo-queue matchmaker undermines the integrity of the game. The experience a professional Dota 2 player has is fundamentally different from what a solo-queue player encounters. I recommend Dota 1X6 in the Arcade, as it offers an FFA structure that eliminates reliance on teammates while preserving the core RPG-oriented PvP experience.  Ability Draft is also excellent, especially since hero-model drafting was introduced. I enjoy it more than the standard 5v5 mode. I cannot fairly evaluate Turbo due to limited playtime, but it appears to deliver its stated goal: shorter matches that still feel similar to Dota 2.  I do not recommend playing this game unless you can regularly assemble a party of five. The time investment is substantial, and the solo-queue return is a net negative for most players. Leaving a match mid-game harms your behavior score, so you are often locked into poor-quality matches.  The game is intensely competitive, and enjoyment heavily depends on team cooperation. You cannot be down a player and still expect a viable outcome. The community is notoriously difficult, and the archetypal Dota 2 player prioritizes shifting blame, giving up when circumstances worsen, and engaging in verbal hostility over pursuing victory.  On the ranked ladder, individual agency is limited. Provided you are neither smurfing nor griefing, your win rate converges around 40–60% regardless of personal effort. Around 40% of your wins and 40% of your losses happen largely independent of your input. The outcome is determined more by matchmaking than by individual performance. You only meaningfully influence a small fraction of 20% of your total matches from a statistical analysis perspective because you queue with four strangers whose actions outweigh your own. This is a game where being the best player doesn't mean being able to win every single match. That is, there are elements of randomness to climbing the game doesn't give 100% feedback on everything you do.  If you can consistently form a full party, the game becomes excellent. With five coordinated players, you have real strategic influence and a controlled team environment. The difficulty lies in assembling a group of four others who are not the prior mentioned archetypal Dota 2 players and whose schedules reliably align. If you can meet those conditions, the game is absolutely worth playing. Most players, however, will not be able to meet them.","buruk"

"76561199817761730","Доброго времени суток уважаемые игроки Dota 2. Нет желания кому-то доказывать, или оправдывать чье-либо мнение. Комментарий сугубо больше для себя для закрепления опыта в данной сфере. В игре будучи с 2025 года и 15 января, я наиграла более 1000 матчей, подняв 1700+ ммр в рейтинге (большая часть в Allpick). За все это время в доте можно ощутить и увидеть весь спектр эмоций, большая часть из которых негативная. Придя сюда увлеченной игрой с человеком и после игры без него, дота не принесла ничего кроме негативных и пустых эмоций. Игра пустая с однообразным геймплеем и тратой времени более чем на час, а бывало и полтора. Ради чего? Ради 25 ПТС. В доте я была активным и достаточно порядочным игроком чтобы оставаться в тени наблюдателем. Люди последними грязными словами кроют в этой игре, желают смерти, кидают угрозы. Те кто имеет другой ранг дабы самоутвердиться готовы низко пасть чтобы удовлетворить свою неполноценность. Люди растеряли свою честь в компьютерной игре, и с пенной у рта готовы грызть друг друга. И вся дота как посев надежды, лотерея. Большая часть игроков никогда не станет известными или не будет участвовать в больших играх, фигурируя как известные крутые команды и тп, они застрянут на своем рейтинге 2к и не сдвинутся. Для игроков это не просто уже способ побега от реальности, а способ укрыться и скоротать время. Но годы идут, мы взрослеем и отдаем лучшие годы впустую. Можно вставить 5 копеек и сказать - Не все такие! Я играю в меру!. Конечно! Мера - есть, но не все ее соблюдают.   Я не рекомендую сюда заходить игрокам которых интересует нормальный геймплей, сугубо сосредоточенный на игре, а не на личностях что смеют оскорблять, ведь даже если таким людям дать ответ они его не поймут. Другой сорт. Моей руки больше в игре этой не будет. Удачи людям в игровом мире. Игры приносят пользу, и иногда даже помогают, но они также могут нанести и вред, если ты далеко в них заходишь.","buruk"

"76561198035064386","As a long-time Dota 2 player since 2013, I’ve witnessed the game evolve—but not always for the better. While the core gameplay remains engaging, Valve’s approach to matchmaking and MMR has become increasingly frustrating, to the point where it feels like the system is actively working against you rather than facilitating fair competition.  -The biggest issue with Dota 2’s ranked system is its apparent forced 50% win rate mechanic. No matter how well you play, the game seems determined to keep you at a certain MMR range by stacking the odds against you, even if you’re a positive player, the game will punish you by pairing you with toxic teammates or griefers if your Behavior Score drops slightly, making climbing nearly impossible, OR  after a few wins, the system will almost always match you against significantly stronger opponents or give you weaker teammates to ""balance"" your progress.  - I mean back in the day, ranking up felt rewarding. Now, it feels like the system is deliberately slowing your progress to keep you playing longer, because of smurfs and boosters ruining games or due to role queue exploits!  - If you’ve been playing since 2013 (like me), you’ve probably noticed that Dota 2 doesn’t reward experience. Even if you take a short break, the game seems to ""forget"" your skill level, placing you in worse matches until you ""prove yourself"" again. The low to mid-tier ranks (Crusander to Legend) are where the worst matchmaking occurs—filled with boosted accounts, griefers, and players who don’t care about winning.  - So, to conclude, if you’ve been stuck in the same rank for years despite improving, it’s not (just) your fault—the system is designed this way. Dota 2’s matchmaking doesn’t prioritize fair games it prioritizes engagement, keeping you grinding endlessly. Unless Valve makes drastic changes, the cycle of frustration will continue, making the game feel more like a chore than a rewarding experience. If you’re tired of the grind, the best solution might be to step away—because Dota 2 clearly doesn’t respect your time 👿","buruk"

You go to unranked expecting just that a game where you can relax, learn and practice with other humans, without ruining other ppl ranked score. Instead you get matched up with very high skilled players that likely come from ranked and get reported every single time if you do a wrong move, leading to you having to wait hours on end for another game or get stuck with bots again. You can get  reported just because, the system is automated, if someone reports you because he feels like, you get temp banned regardless if you played good or bad.

"76561198355138547","Hello, my name is Miguel, I… I would like to expose my pain, my anguish, my despair, and above all, my years of loneliness that were falsely hidden by this curse they call a game, and that only got worse after I learned how to play Invoker. I… I deeply regret ever starting this.  The year was 2017, I was a young boy wandering and browsing the internet, I needed something to get addicted to and unfortunately, I chose this game instead of pornography or methamphetamine. You, reader, might think I’m exaggerating or using extreme situations to expose my unhappiness. But truly, honestly, maybe it would be better to be in prison right now, paying for the crime of drug use and dealing, serving my 15-year sentence and in the end… in the end, seeing the sunlight and not feeling pain, guilt, sadness, and maybe, maybe, even after all of it, a desire to feel that pain again — that pain more addictive than cocaine. Gabe Newell produced not a game, but a pact you sign, and that pact is Dota 2.  Not because it’s a bad game, not just because of that, but because it consumes you like a demon. It feeds on your pain, your sadness, your anger, and it only grows stronger. Believe me, I’m a rational guy and I’m sure there’s no explanation other than supernatural for what happens when you play this game. It’s the equivalent of shoving a pineapple into your anus and, after bleeding intensely and stabilizing, ripping it out, pouring hot oil, and then pouring alcohol on top of it all. And yet, despite everything, you still feel the urge to repeat the experience.  So yes, it was a pact. I spend my time with this game while it drains my life energy, and in return, I receive trauma, I receive emptiness. I look at the world and see how much time I’ve lost. I could have taken up gardening, learned sign language, become a bodybuilder, or even an astronaut!!!

"76561198018664975","Having played heros of the storm, smite, and to an extent other MOBAs, Dota has the worst new player experience by far thanks to smurfing, stunlock being a core mechanic for pretty much every single build and being killed from offscreen at max health.  I thought stunlocking was obnoxious in smite, I now see I was drastically wrong. Offscreen killings are more common than on screen once you've hit mid-later mid game. I don't want to learn this game having experienced this for four matches straight out of the new player queue (which still had smurfs in it)  I can understand why someone would enjoy this game if they put the time in. I do not want to do that. Being called shit over comms and in end game chat by the opposing team's top frag kinda cemented it for me.","buruk"
"76561198371658485","I’ve had a frustrating experience with this game. After taking a break and returning, I noticed an unusual pattern: initially, my allies would be significantly stronger than the enemies, making the game feel too easy. However, once I got invested, the matchmaking system seemed to change drastically. I began encountering matches filled with unskilled or toxic teammates, while the opposing team felt disproportionately powerful.  This cycle of alternating between favorable and frustrating matchups feels manipulative and disheartening. I suspect the game’s analytics and matchmaking algorithms are designed to create this pattern, which ultimately affects the enjoyment and fairness of the experience.  Unfortunately, this has impacted my mental well-being and overall experience with the game, and I’ve decided to uninstall it.","buruk"

I guess im one of those scum that is not meant for this game.   my current experience is even tho its meant to be a team work game but im playing it more individualistic then ever. this is due to me not playing with my friends but just play turbo with stranger constantly and uneven matchup. this is good bye. feel like ive been in this ""marriage"" for years not happy and just self loathing trying to spend time but never felt the connection with it again.     I'd like to thank the game developer for trying to make it good for new commers as well as old peeps like me. Ever update make sense and creative skills and gameplay. i will continue to watch pros play but from now stopping the urge to play that hero that i can relate to.

After roughly  6000 hours, 15 years, and enough emotional trauma to fill a small, very angry book, I'm officially filing my release papers from Dota 2.  This game is less a form of entertainment and more a slow-burning psychological experiment designed to test the absolute limits of human patience, all while teaching you creative new ways to insult strangers over the internet.    Quitting felt less like leaving a game and more like escaping an abusive relationship where I was constantly told I was 'carrying' when really I was just being used for gold and emotional baggage. The graphics are okay, I guess, if you enjoy staring at the same muddy colors and slightly unsettling character models for years on end. The gameplay is ... well, it exists. It certainly happens.    Pros:  You learn highly specialized terminology that is useless in the real world.  My life has 400% more sunlight now.    Cons:  My monitor is still sticky from the stress sweat.  I lost my favorite hoodie betting on a match I didn't understand.    In summary, this game is a masterpiece of misery. It’s highly addictive, completely soul-crushing, and I absolutely recommend that you run far, far away.    Overall Rating: 10/10 (If you measure by the sheer amount of time it can steal from a human soul)  P.S. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside, looking at a tree. I hear they're quite nice.","buruk"

However, I also understand not wanting to leave out new players. for this I would recomend that players are required to play maybe 100 to 200 games in something like new player mode to mitigate this. Another benefit to this is that it would also deter smurfs.","buruk"
"76561199711672579","this game has a non fair player matching system that sends you back and forth on win/lose streaks, which keeps you on an average ELO and simultaneously keeps you hooked so that you don't uninstall. this can be easily confirmed simply by checking stats of each individual player in a game and seeing that the winning team is either on a win streak or just broke a lose streak, and the losing team is the same but inverted. if you're not outright griefing your matches, the game coordinator keeps your win rate close to 50% by teaming you with players that will either compensate your lack of skill or be much worse than players 1000 MMR below you. the only way to get to higher MMR is to create a new account and start over, not making a single mistake while you're calibrating. there is no ""grind"". you can't just play the game well and improve your rank. you have to play exceptionally, never make mistakes, and not count on any help from the players that the game coordinator threw into your team. it is just exhausting. the game is fun only outside ranked matchmaking","buruk"

Lately you will be getting a bunch of Smurfs and they do nothing if you report these Smurf accounts, despite stating that they will be going harder on people with 2 or more accounts. This really makes a great game not so much worth playing anymore. People who spend money to make their heroes look good and just try to have a good time in a competitive game and then you end up playing against a bunch of smurf accounts and the new players in your team are actually new players. So if you are in the lower MMR brackets. If you report players for Griefing, they take immediate action, but for Smurfing, absolutely no action.

"76561198331076107","I really love this game, been playing it religiously since 2013. However, I am very disappointed with how no one is reviewing reports and banning cases in this game. I recently convinced one of my friends to try and play DOTA 2. Since he had a new account, we could only play normal matches together. I main Invoker so as broken as he is, I would normally get lots of kills and have a real presence in the map. However, due to playing Invoker how he is supposed to be played, I was reported as a smurf and ultimately got banned. I appreciate the effort that DOTA is giving to prevent smurfs and hackers from destroying the game, but I am just disappointed with how I was wrongfully banned. I tried sending an appeal, offered to give evidence that this is my only and main account, but I was only given a generic reply. I am writing this to warn people. There is a big power currently given to reports. Play well enough or piss enough number of people and you will be saying goodbye to your account. Nevertheless, the game is fun and addicting. I kind of thankful that I am unable to play so I can stop wasting time on this game LOL.   Note: the lobbies that I get matched into usually have 1-3 players in the enemy team that is either as good as me or better.  Additionally, I do not send harmful stuffs through chat at all, worse that I can say is ask ""where is your bkb?"" to my carry. Lastly, I spammed invoker around 5 years ago, my skills on him is definitely on a higher level compared to how I play other heroes.","buruk"

If you have played a MOBA before, you will literally not be able to decipher this games cesspool of a UI system on the first try. Even if you've played Warcraft 3 through or DOTA 1.

To boot, almost every menu is a scheme to get you to play more, to get armor sets, and to buy new cosmetics. I don't care about any of that. You boot the game and you are immediately overwhelmed by a deplorable amount of Valve Classic TF2 hat garbage nothing that has to do with learning or playing the game. It's just disappointing.  In fairness, this game is immensely complex, has robust levels of play, and a totally free roster (something all other mobas lack). Pro play is fantastic to watch and there's so many unique strategies to approach a match.  If you are a real human and don't have that much time to dedicate playing video games: Don't. Play. This. You will get stuck in a feedback loop sucking Valve's downstairs and ultimately shredding your life force away. For what? An intrinsic esoteric abstraction of a single mod for Warcraft 3. Stop while you still can. Get a girlfriend, get a job, get a skillset, and for the love of Christ go and play one of the thousands of unique titles out there right now.

I expected Dota 2 to be hard, deep, maybe even rewarding in time. Instead, I found a game that actively hates new players.  [h2] Hero Design – Welcome to the Stun-Lock Hell[/h2] Dota 2 doesn’t teach you. It punishes you. • Enemies strike from fog with absurd range. • You're stunned before you see them. • You're deleted before you can blink. • There’s no counterplay, no outplay, no escape.  This isn't a learning curve – it’s a spike through your skull.  [h2] Thrown Into the Fire, Alone[/h2] I requested a coach. No one came. There’s no tutorial that actually helps. No guidance. No mentoring. You're tossed into matches with veterans who will tear you apart, and if you ask for help? Expect pings, flames, or silence.  Dota 2 doesn’t care if you’re learning. It just wants you to suffer or quit.  [h2] The Item System – Designed to Confuse, Not Enhance[/h2] • Active items with no visual clarity • Courier juggling like it’s StarCraft • Recipes that make zero sense • Mandatory outside research just to function  I spent more time alt-tabbing to Wikis than actually playing the game. At some point I asked myself: Is this even fun anymore?  [h2] Chaos Disguised as Depth[/h2] Early game? Slow and punishing. Mid game? Fog ganks and surprise deaths. Late game? Blink in, die instantly, stare at death screen.  I didn’t get better. I got numb and I couldn’t learn from my mistakes because I didn’t even understand what killed me.  It’s not ""deep gameplay."" It’s opaque and abusive game design.  [h2] Community – Gatekeeping on Steroids[/h2] • Ask a question? Get mocked. • Die once? ""Report noob."" • Try to play safe? ""Why u no help?""

"76561199076478027","If you are worried about your mental health, I gotta warn ya, dota 2 community is toxic as HELL and Valve made it super easy for these toxic people to report you ""for no reason at all"".. yeah that's right. each player gets to report another, 6 times in each match. and it does not end at this point. admins who ban ya also dont know anything about roles. For example if pick a sup and the carry is too dumb to make the game a win, you CAN NOT act like a boss and stand up for kills. You gotta just move behind the dumbest core ever till enemy finishes the game in 60 mins. That is what this game has transformed to. A pool of toxicity that when you show creativity, they just throw you to LOW priority. NOW, what is low priority you may ask? Its a match unlike what you installed on your computer. in fact you kinda get to play another game. with only 3 heroes. its a game of chances that this toxic community LOOOOOVEEEES. I've been playing since dota 1. so more than your age probably. I recommend that you don't install this game until they fix the Behavior Score policy. it just ruins your day when you are super niceee and super creative and then coming back to your PC to play a game in which you payed $2000 of skins, and NOPE you can not play this game. you gotta play Single draft with the most stupid players on the surface of this planet till you win 5 matches. and you wont win for like 10 or 12 matches which takes 5 days of a normal human with a JOB ^_^ yeahh. Also the ranking system is super stupid. you just cant win a 1 v 9 game when you get the worst team mates who think of nothing but ruining your experience and revenge on ""why did you tell me to buy wards?"". as Gaben said, he does not care about our feedback.

"76561198328334174","This game genuinely changed my life for the worse. The moment i opened this game my mother was hit by a truck tire flying at 200km/h after a brutal accident. After she died, it turned out that she misspelled my name in the will and everything she left me was sent to a random person. After that, I sat down and tried to play the game, but my chair broke and i fell onto the floor. In anger, i threw my broken chair at a wall, which made my entire house collapse. Because my house collapsed, all my possessions were buried under the rubble and the only thing that remained was my PC setup. I tried to calm down by playing some Dark Souls III, but my steam library glitched and now the only game I can play is Overwatch 2. While I was playing, I got a phone call saying that I had been convicted for murder and was going to prison for life, because when I collapsed my house, the shock wave caused my neighbours cooking oil to tip onto his turned on gas stove, which blew him up immediately. When I got to prison, they said I was being sentenced to death, and asked for my last meal. I wanted a Big Mac no pickles, but McDonalds got the order wrong and gave me a cold McChicken with extra pickles.

"76561199070379055","Dota 2 is an amazing game, that is better then the fucking league in every way i like. The reason because this review is negative is because this game pretty much fucked up my life. Is it majorly because of my irresponsibility? Sure. But no game other than this is nearly as addictive once you get into it. It was a dark period of me living in my 14m² playing this game for up to 16 hours per day, with this game giving me illusion of accomplishment with each win, and a need to get my MMR back whenever I lose. A neverending cycle of dopamine rush and withdrawal. Stopping playing it was the best decision of my life. If you ever realise that you are spending too much time in this game - uninstall it and promise to yourlelf that you will never play it again, even when the friends are asking you. If you are responsible or already have an established life thay you are reasonably happy with - this game probably won't hurt you, and it may be good for you. But if you are an irresponsible student with ADHD like me - don't ever even think about getting into this. Because if you like it, you might end up like me.","buruk"
"76561198018347508","I came back to Dota after years and I can't believe what you've done to it. I search for ranked matches in West EU. Literally in every game more than half of the players are from countries other than West EU. Everywhere is full of Russians or Ukrainians. They shout into the voice chat in their own language. They flood the chat text with meaningless characters that no one understands. There's nothing you can do about it. As soon as you politely ask these monkeys for English, that they play in Western Europe, you get even more Russian and Ukrainian as an answer. This is not fun, friends. It really is not. The only option is to mute everyone, but then I can go play any singleplayer and I'll have the same experience. I can't play on more Western servers because of the ping.  I absolutely don't understand why I can't ban heroes in ranked games. The game itself bans heroes completely randomly. What's the point of that?  There is no system in the game to give up a game you've already lost. For example, in a game where everyone is yelling at each other in Ukrainian and Russian. In a game where the pick fails and in the 10th minute the score is 0:20 and it is clear to everyone that it is a loss. In such games you make the players suffer another 20-50 minutes. For leaving earlier and saving nerves and mental health you penalize. Because you don't want the players to have fun. You want them to suffer until the last second. This is not fun, friends. It really is not.  There are many similar games like your Dota on the market. Just get inspired by others. Take the best from them. What you are missing. And for God's sake implement it. You have been working on the game for 12 years and it really doesn't look like that.  In its current state, Dota is almost unplayable. It has nothing to do with fun.","buruk"

"76561199183803790","I must say, this is a creative game collecting vinyl records, lighters, and troll dolls satisfies many people's collecting obsessions.  However, this game has fatal flaws:  1. Object collision detection is unresolved. For a game developed using the Unreal Engine, failing to implement even the most basic functionality makes it a poorly made product.  The consequences are severe: a. Players can use any bullet to kill other players through any obstacle.  b. Characters can embed themselves inside buildings, making them visible to people outside.  2. The bullet trajectory is completely wrong bullets travel almost straight, with no fall or wind drift. Only simple recoil and breathing causing aiming deviation are present.  Bullets are completely unaffected by initial velocity, allowing for arbitrarily long ranges.  For example, I can easily kill someone with two shots from a shotgun at 30 yards,  while a Thompson submachine with a lower initial velocity, at 10-20 yards, can hit four or more bullets without killing them.  3. One-third of the players are cheaters becuz cheat codes are open source, meaning 2-3 out of every 9 players in a match are cheaters.  Even with cheat codes, some people are very good at pretending to be innocent. However, some players don't care at all and go unpunished.  Here are a few simple examples of cheating:  a. Invincible type: They don't take any damage no matter what you do.  b. X-ray vision type: They know your location, your equipment, and the mines and traps you've planted. If your equipment is weak, they'll chase you if you've planted mines, they won't go near them.  You crouch behind a rock and wait for them when they come, they just shoot through the rock and get a headshot.  c. Auto-aiming type: You can't kill them within 10 yards behind them (because it's difficult to aim at the head while running and the bullet trajectory is incorrect), but they can turn around and get a headshot in 0.1 seconds.  4. For many average players, waiting 3 or even 10 minutes to team up, only to be killed less than a minute into the game, makes for a terrible gaming experience.  As a veteran shooter who never uses cheats, my kill/death ratio in typical shooters is 8:1, even with a few encounters with cheaters.  In this game, however, my kill/death ratio is below 1:10.  I'm a special player I enjoy playing against cheaters because it greatly improves my skills. That's why I can achieve an 8:1 ratio in other shooters.  But not in this game.  5. To adapt to the harsh game environment, no matter how bad it is, play the game, don't let the game play you.  I adopted a strategic approach, treating it like a survival mini-game, completely avoiding direct head-on shootouts with other players, because humans simply cannot overcome auto-aiming and wallhacks you have no chance.  So I imagined it as the game having eight other ""robot terminators,"" and I need to use my wits to gather resources and escape safely.  I never use any high-quality guns once you carry one, there's a 90% chance of losing it, so I only carry a Thompson or nothing at all.  I became the weekly champion after only 3 days of playing.  6. Due to the terrible gaming experience, there are very few players, probably only a few hundred, so the wait time is quite long. Most of them are new players who joined because the game is free.  7. Finally, a word of advice to game developers: don't outsource game development anymore. Even the best ideas can turn into disasters.","buruk"

Im a noob in this genre and this game seems more overwhelming than its competitors, which makes the tutorials more important. There are a ton of tutorials but a lot of them seem broken or out of order (a test game comes before the movement tutorial). Tutorials like the teleportation one or the middle game one (which introduces the shop a bit more) do not progress and are just stuck on step 1. The community tutorial also doesn't work as there are no messages on screen on what to do. I guess at some time it used to work but now its just broken. New players are forced to use other sources to learn the basics of the game, such as youtube. Im okay with that if its a single player game or if figuring the game out is an intended part of the experience.

"76561199385513328","I will tell you about my negative experience and why i dont think its a ""healty gameplay experience"" and you can decide for yourselves.    I am playing ranked games to enter which u need to play 100 hours first to sort of learn the game and then calibrate your rank , i don't really care about rank itself but its the only mode to play if you care to minimise matchups where your teammates or opponents teammates will ""TRY"" to win and play game with ""less griefing or afk"" . Once your in Ranked you have choice to play Role based mode or Classic mode , which is there to determine your hero picks and position on map and your role in team.    My biggest issue with the game is how rank system and behaviour system works and how tools that determine those numbers ""work"" (spoiler - they are not). Let me give you example which happened to me almost every third game : I play ranked role , select hero and role (i choose all roles as i can play any and mostly get assigned to support or offlane) what usually happens - you get put in a matchup with people who are in premade pairs or trios in your team , so you end up with (you) (two friends) (two friends) or (you) (three friends) (solo guy) , this happens alot - but what happens next is leading to negative experience based on tools in game - those players who are together with a chance of 80% based on my games will play their own game and only interact with each other - most of the time they will flame (toxic) you or other single player and blame those who are not in their premade group for everything that went wrong iin game in their believe (human nature)  ... in result you will keep getting reports from those people almost 90% of games you loose and even if you win game in the end they would still throw reports if they believe you didnt play well . And trust me , for every third game you get that WIN or Lose ... This will drop your behavior score down - which will result in u unable to communicate , ping , make calls ,etc in your games untill your behaviour score goes up ( which never does - the more you play the lower it goes , and trust me - i didnt even communicate or being toxic cus i couldnt - game prevents me) the more u play - the lower it will eventually go .    My point is - tools designed to improve game - actually ruin it for you big time , because people have no penalty of spamming reports and they can do it for reason or without it , in every single match you play .    And not being able to communicate in a team game with your team - takes away a major aspect of this game and a very important aspect - sometimes a few good team calls can win you game and bring morale back in case its down . Imagine you are a part of squad at war but nobody can talk to each other -  you can see each other yes-  but you cant tell each other what is the plan ... in a game of dota2 it is a crucial aspect to win a match imho. Especially in lower ranks where people still learn and you can help each other and point out where to go , what items to suggest and etc.   So - your rank drops faster since you cant communicate , since your behaviour score also drops , and you keep getting people with same rank and behaviour in your games - they also cant talk to each other .   And believe me you dont even have to do anything bad - people will keep reporting you almost every game , just cus they can . Either mad that you lost and spam report to entire team or cus of their own mental issues ! ... Been there.   Now ask yourself why would you play a game with such a system in place , that will take away lots of time , a game that requires a lot of time to learn and even more to master - just to end up not being able to even communicate on the battlefield in the time of need... you simply cant play effective when team cant coordinate in this game... BTW - every time you get reports - you can also end up penalised for 4 hrs  - not being able to play , this penalty can go up to 24 hrs and so on - and after you will have to play Single Draft mode and obligated to win 1-4 games depending on penalty - to get back into Ranked mode.   And culmination of this - if your account will drop below 2k behaviour score - you will not be able to play Ranked games at all . It takes time to get so low - but remember - once you go down to 6k behaviour score - its only a way down - how fast  - depends on luck .   Nicely designed tools , right ? what you think is it worth it ?","buruk"

The game is truthfully awful in every way imaginable, but that's the beauty of it. All sort of phychological traits start to emerge and it can be a reflection process throughout, as if you get free therapy sessions:  1. Mental Health Growth - Realize I might be procrastinating and play the game to feel good in order to get worse (knowingly). - You will Blame yourself, but others do too... So you can both reflect on how to blame passively, just like those co-workers I hate in the office.  2. Ego-pride Conduct - Playing Gracefully? WRONG | Advising Teammate? WRONG | Muting the Game? WRONG... so what is RIGHT? --> Exactly.  3. Organization - Each of your own friend/teammate have a role in-game. The funny thing is, you know how they fare IRL compared to when they are in-game. Then you know how lame players are actually cool IRL. - Planning, scheming, synergizing... These are old school. You should just wait for the patch, just like how the world always reset itself in each financial crisis.   All in all, I thank all of those who played with me. I can see how these addicted fellows do in life Right Now compared to when they played with me in my college years (around 500-1000hrs) and I can say: majority of them uninstall the game and don't look back. So I might do that as well... To move-on to other things that really matter, including all other good games that these sorry-ass people miss because they still play this out-of-date game to this day.","buruk"

Worst part is when you inevitably fall behind in the first 10 seconds of gameplay you cannot recover no matter what because you have no fucking concept on what to do, your match WILL be boring and you might as well afk in the fountain until it's done. win or lose you still wasted an hour of your life because the other guys in your lane leveled up before you so now they magically 1 shot you, regen all of their hp and mana the second they're off screen and have perfect coordination to kill you every time.

I went from 1250 to 700 in matter of  15 days  due to always being in DIRE and have idiots in my team.

In 90% of games in DIRE ,against oposing playes that are paying DOTA + memebrs. Also, in most cases against party (in my team no party)...

"76561198242548206","Dota 2 is an amazing game with deep strategy, great heroes, and a lot of skill expression. The gameplay itself is seriously fun and addictive.  But the community can be extremely toxic, and the report/behavior system feels really unfair. You can join a match, play calmly, communicate, and do your best — and still get reported just because your team lost and someone wants to blame you. Even worse, a toxic teammate can report you for no reason, and you end up getting punished anyway. Your behavior score drops, and sometimes you even get bans that feel completely undeserved.  The game is great, but the experience is often ruined by the toxic environment and a report system that’s too easy to abuse. Valve really needs to improve moderation and make reports more accurate and harder to misuse.","buruk"

They spent half the game chatting — no idea about what. Long story short: Our mid started griefing and literally gave the enemy two rampages. I had to kill my own mid just to stop the game from completely collapsing. End result? Lost the ranked match. Lost MMR. Lost my sanity.

I came back after a long, long break (I stopped playing after MK release and came back shortly in 2022ish for Marci) and I was curious how the game really is all these years later. They made the game accessible to anybody, heroes have passives and facets (which you select before the game to alter your hero), talent tree is still not removed for some reason, heroes have no identity, they all can carry the game for some reason. Some beloved heroes have been changed a little, some like Omniknight are completely different for no reason whatsoever. Why change something that was fine? Aghanim's shard is a joke, the woods and map are completely changed for the worse, Roshan now patrols the river for some reason and will throw you aside for a billion damage if you get in his way, scan is a thing for some reason giving you pings in are if enemy moves there, there are shrines where you get free XP so even a clown can stay in levels since they killed the roaming support archetype, there are free healing items on the side of the map instead of the shop, teleporting gates from one side of the map to the other, every hero can kill wards even on high ground even if they're melee...  I can go on and on forever. They added so much unnecessary garbage that the game can hardly even considered DotA anymore. This game should be called Dota 2: Electric Boogaloo League of Legends Bang Bang Rift.  This is not DotA, this is not the DotA experience. Might as well play the DotA on Frozen Throne for the true experience. What a joke, what a disaster. OG game ruined this much and for what? Ease of access to new players?

It'd take me months just to read through what the characters can do. The interface for doing so is awful. Then there's items. Thousands of items, some only viewable at certain times. This game was made for AI to play. not a human.    The matchmaking is AWFUL. Absolute trash. Unranked matches means no matchmaking protocol. You get who you get and you need to sit through 50 games to go ranked to find a balance mechanism in the matchmaking.    I don't understand why playing against people who one shot you at range is fun for me as a beginner. Why would i ever keep playing this game?    Its sad that those who enjoy this game, the majority of players are unranked or low level ranked, thats how the numbers work, based solely on their ability to play new players.    It's like some people get off playing only against significantly weaker competition.

I dont have to play a whole month to see how this works.Randomly ill log in one day and Ill be nerfed simply because I chose to keep playing.    The character models are bad. Straight up. They look terrible.    Someone explain how a ranged attacker who can stealth and one shot, or can slow and enemy and do hundreds of AoE damage after only a few levels can ever be beat by a slow walking melee idiots who hits just as hard and as slow as any other character?

"76561198093259880","Don't play it. I've played Dota2 in every iteration thats existed. But its not worth spending money on. They don't care about balance or about the playerbase. They've ruined the dynamic for most of the heroes and they only care about continuing to make money off of people buying cosmetics. The regions are a joke, good luck finding a game in a US server thats not chinese, peruvian, or russian. If you don't come with a premade party its not worth playing, you'll be stuck in MMR hell. Griefers and bots abound. The learning curve is steep and they ""adjust"" popular heroes nerfing and buffing them so about the time you have a handle on something it'll be ruined and the new meta grief will start up. Makes the game absolutely trash to play. If they want to fix it, fix the regions, stop ""balancing"" and just releasing $$$ cosmetics for cash grabs and start listening to your playerbase again.","buruk"

Every ban wave they do is a higher number of hackers banned.  It was like 2k hackers when the first started doing it and now it's up to 50k accounts when they do it.  Then the hackers just go make and new account and download the game again.  It's stupid.  And when I call people for scripting I get reported for being toxic.

I’ve enjoyed many great moments, and the competitive environment keeps the experience intense and engaging. However, one major issue that holds the game back is the smurfing problem. It affects match quality and can make games feel unfair, especially for newer or lower-ranked players. I really hope the developers take stronger action to balance and reduce smurfs in the game.

"76561198319324721","Dota 2 could be an amazing game. The mechanics are deep, the hero roster is huge, and trying different hero/item combinations can actually be really fun. There’s so much potential for creativity and experimentation… in theory.  But the problem is simple: the community does not let you enjoy any of that.  The moment you try something new—something even slightly outside the sacred “meta”—you’re instantly blamed for everything. People act like there’s only one correct way to play every hero, one mandatory item path, and any attempt to innovate automatically means you’re throwing the game. It’s suffocating. And the worst part? It’s not even true. Non-meta builds can win. But try telling that to teammates who explode the second you buy anything they didn’t see in a pro match last week.  What could be an interesting and creative strategy game ends up feeling like a strict, joyless homework assignment. You queue up hoping to have fun, and instead you get five strangers treating you like a criminal because you dared to build something different.  And yes—matches last forever. It’s a massive time sink, and for what? To get yelled at for trying to enjoy yourself?

The only thing you’ll truly gain here isn’t skill, and it’s definitely not new friends. It’s a toxic relationship strong enough to break through the gates of hell.

The entire internet combined still isn’t as toxic as the Dota community. Every curse word, every language, every accent compressed perfectly into every single match for your premium consumption.  And yet, I’m still playing. Because I can’t quit. I’ve already become addicted to my own sadness.  Score: 11/10 If you want to waste your life stylishly, this is the game for you.

"76561198070381226","It was once worth it.    Horrid Reporting System:  It's not easy getting back your rating. I went down from 11000 to 3000. I just got back to 7000.  I've played this Game since it's inception and it's really toxic. ^That's why their is a mute button.    Here's the rundown - Those muted toxic people, they have ways of bring you down to their level.    How to be Toxic 101.  Step 1: Team-up with Toxic people (4/3 squad).  Step 2: Queue.  Step 3: See Pos 5/4/3/2/1 player pick.  Step 4: Ask for Pos 5/4/3/2/1.  Step 5: Get Denied.  Step 6: Bully the player that doesn't do what you want.  Step 7: Feed.  Step 8: Complain that said player isn't doing something after dying.  Step 9: Verbally abuse the player  Step 10: Report player for saying/typing/doing anything. (typing ""gg"" counts as text chat, saying hello counts as voice chat, farming creeps when your teleportation scroll is on cooldown counts as behavior.)  Step 11: Bait the player and leave them to die. then report for griefing.  Step 12: Feed by soloing 5 enemies, then go in 1 by 1, then report the last one alive for griefing.  Step 13: Ignore teammate because they weren't at 1 fight or did something to fracture your tiny ego.    Alternatively as a Solo player you can always.  -Jungle til the end of the game and cost all 4 the game.  -Spam the same voice lines constantly when off cooldown.   -Solo the enemies whenever you return from certain death.  -Some heroes/items can troll their teammates. (Bane, Rubick, Tiny, Venge, Forcestaff and more.)    I was matched up with/against familiar toxic players who reported me every game I played with/against them. I know this because you can see when and how many reports you received, so you can work out when you match-up with the same names and get the same amount of reports. *multiple times.     Once they matched up enough against you. You get start losing your rating 700 points a day. I tried using the avoid function that comes with Plus. They just end up on the other team and report you again.   The irony is that valve accepts a report from the same player that technically would have had to report you for chat/voice which toggles you as muted, then they would remove mute and report you again. (Why  is that a thing, by un-muting they are agreeing to see/hear whatever that player was muted for previously.)    Those toxic players that are genuinely toxic, they just buy or create a new account and you end up in a whirlpool of toxic sludge, sinking deeper and deeper until you learn that the only way back is to say absolutely nothing, no calls, no strategy, no assisting, not even a ""gg"".    When you start and get past waiting for ages for a match-up, after multiple matches against or with the same 4 stack of griefers mass reporting you. Until you are in a lower tier, then everyone reports you for anything and everything, so you just get lower. The only way to get back up is to not speak, or ping, or use the voice lines you get with plus.     Essentially paying to have horrid match-ups.     I just made it back to 7000, I can't even advise someone as a more experienced player without it being treated as toxic. Rarely a match-up is acceptable, if not it's some teammate that can't play because they don't do the freaking tutorial. Then it's someone that doesn't know there are 5 positions for a reason. The deeper you go, the worse it gets, 3 games in a row with at least 2 griefers. That stop playing 1 minute into the game because their teammate picked the same position or died once or didn't stack a camp or didn't follow them into certain death.     @valve Just keep muted players muted, if you choose to un-mute, then you are agreeing that you cannot report that player again for chat/voice. I'd rather have 4 muted toxic players that can't report me out of spite than this reporting system that gives them power. Surely you can get a formula that matches in-game behaviour based on the player and not the toxic teammates.

I only play ranked games and its so frustrating how dumb and selfish people pick their heroes or apply for the wrong roles.  There are certain regions to the east that like to play on EU west servers. Not only refuse most of them to speak english, they are mostly toxic as well.

"76561198000842683","While I appreciate Valve effort to make the game Linux compatible, it is quite unstable given it is a competitive and old game. it crashed very often. then players try to reconnect. If you dont manage to reconnect within 5 min, Hell  boy, the game will make you pay for it. Prevents you for playing for 1 day, moves you to low priority matchmaking queues,  does not allow you to chat (even to plan an attack or anything) and only makes you play I kind of game where you hero is picked randomly.  Most of the time, Steam will prevent the game from running after a crash and will make you wait 10-20 minutes to ""download content"". I still have no idea what that content is, but you can be sure that after being put into the low priority status, you wont be content for long.  Overall, the game improves the mechanics of DOTA 1 and delivers fast dopamine, but the punitive system regarding the disconnections is unbearable given the constant crashes. Tried to climb out of the low priority queue, but it is impossible.  it is filled with trash players and the crashes made my situation worst.  This game will make you frustrated and unhappy. STAY AWAY","buruk"
"76561198054286618","I've been playing dota for years, but honestly, this game has turned into a massive disappointment. It keeps crashing for no reason and its definitely not my PC’s fault. My specs can handle far heavier games smoothly, yet dota keeps freezing and crashing like it’s still in early beta access. Imagine losing mmr or wasting time because of poor optimization that’s never fixed.    I finally gave up and switched to Xbox and Battle.net to play FPS games and you know what? The experience is miles better. Even though steam has a lot of fps titles, I chose to leave it completely because steam and valve have become so unreliable. Their systems feel outdated, their games feel neglected, and the overall experience just isn’t worth it anymore.    What’s even worse is how dota’s integrity keeps falling apart. Even my long time dota friends have quit because the game feels unfair and broken. The matchmaking algorithm is a joke once you go on a win streak, the system suddenly matches you with impossible lineups just to ruin your momentum. It doesn’t matter if you play well or maintain good behavior the algorithm feels punishing instead of rewarding.    And to make things even more frustrating, valve can’t even properly handle account recovery issues. When someone else gets access to your account, you’ll go through endless verification steps. Even if you already have solid evidence proving you’re the real owner, they’ll keep demanding more and more details like they don’t even want to help you recover it. It’s a complete waste of time.    At this point, I’m done. This game sucks, and valve has completely lost its touch. The passion, fairness, and fun that once made dota great are gone. The company doesn’t listen, the support is terrible, and the quality keeps going downhill.    I’ll never use steam or any valve game again. Dota’s legacy is fading fast, and Gen Z players don’t even care about it anymore. valve needs to wake up — because the way things are going, dota is no longer a legend… it’s just another forgotten game.","buruk"

So yeah, be aware of this fact before you start dumping your precious time into it.","buruk"
"76561199115471456","The neon glow of the computer shop flickered against the rain outside. Inside, rows of gamers sat hunched over their keyboards, faces lit by the chaotic swirl of spells and explosions on-screen. Diego had been playing Dota 2 for years. Thousands of hours, countless sleepless nights, and yet—every match felt like rolling dice with fate. Tonight, he swore it would be different. Tonight, he would climb out of the trench of despair known as Herald rank. The draft began. His teammates argued instantly. “Pick carry!” one shouted. “No, I’m mid!” another barked. Diego sighed and locked in Crystal Maiden. Support again. The thankless role. The horn sounded, and the battle began. For the first ten minutes, everything went well. Diego warded, stacked camps, and saved allies with clutch Frostbite. But then it happened—the curse of Dota. His carry disconnected. His midlaner bought a Divine Rapier at 15 minutes. His offlaner spammed chat: “GG go next.” The enemy team snowballed. Towers fell like dominoes. Diego fought desperately, but every spell felt like throwing water at a wildfire. Finally, the Ancient crumbled. Defeat. The screen flashed: -25 MMR. Diego leaned back, staring at the ceiling. The rain outside had stopped, but inside, the storm raged on. He whispered to himself: “Why do I keep coming back?” And then, as if answering, the game client chimed: “Searching for next match…” Diego laughed bitterly. Dota wasn’t just a game—it was a trap. A labyrinth where victory was fleeting, teammates were enemies, and time itself was the final boss. Yet tomorrow, he knew he’d sit down again, chasing that one perfect match that never truly existed.","buruk"

"76561198141851932","i played 7432 hour and i hate that i like this game...its potential is amazing but there's a few ( major ) things that are really annoying. the scoring system ( behavior system ) needs a complete re-haul... you can have a perfect score and if you disconnect or abandon a game once, the penalty is too high. There should be benefits to scoring higher ( x amount of abandons or accidental disconnects or less penalty time from missing match ques..etc. ).. good and bad behavior is also treated the same.","buruk"

"76561199386129828","Dev, pls fix your game server. All the players are experiencing terrible network and I couldn't blame my own home wifi because this is an early month and my wifi had refreshed. Your game is currently terrible and this game is known the oldest game since 2013. You are not just showing your product on steam lobby but it is also important to fix bugs lingering around in the network.","buruk"
