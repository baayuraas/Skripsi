"76561198438294956","This game is like an abusive ex. You know the relationship you have with them is toxic but you keep coming back thinking that this time would be different.","baik"
"76561199716640512","The game is wonderful and very kind to beginners... While they are in the menu.  The community is not only positive, but also has telepathic skills. They told me that my dad wasn't really my dad, and my mom wasn't working where I thought she was.  Also, one of the advantages is that there are many doctors playing Dota 2 and they can easily diagnose your mental and physical abilities.","baik"
"76561198363396230","Man, DOTA will always be a good game. The best MOBA for me. Never been bored playing it and always makes me comeback for more. The player based are somewhat toxic but in a competitive way, it only depends on how you view and take it. The time, attention, money and friendship that I manage to make and spend in this game will always be worth it. After playing this game for many years I have decided to quit, hence the review. I am quitting due to medical reasons and I am already too old for game. It's just pure nostalgia that fuels me to continue but it is time to hang up. Enjoy the game, always have a positive mental attitude towards the game and thank you DOTA for all the memories. GGWP!","baik"
"76561198116675004","I don't even know why I'm still playing  It's like a session to chit-chat with friends while having some side content  Looking back at the hours played, I wonder what would change if I put a quarter of that to piano or something, learning new languages, meeting new people, enjoying different types of art. But all I could do is wonder because you can't change the past. I don't even know if I can change the present because this is a hard addiction.  Despite all those, it's hands down the best MOBA. It's very complex and deep, but that also means it's harder for beginners to learn.  I'll give it a thumbs up. Not many games could take 4000+ hours from me.","baik"
"76561199055003635","This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers. Then it taught me to hate them all.  And it is the best program for learning the Russian language.","baik"
"76561198095450436","✔ Ego simulator ✔ Patience simulator ✔ Instant decision-making simulator ✔ Work environment simulator ✔ Social discrepancy simulator ✔ Anxiety simulator ✔ A game with noticeable RTS elements, not bad. ✔ Anger management simulator ✔ Team building simulator  A highly complex game with weird mechanics. It is a hard game because it's too long and the learning curve is too vast for a starter player. Recommended but play with precaution because it can literally ruin your life or save your life. Double edged sword to say at least.","baik"

"76561197996774379","This is quite simply the greatest competitive team based multiplayer game that has ever been created. It is just an exquisite work of art.  The community is toxic. Yes. 10/10","baik"
"76561197970562209","Strangely, or perhaps not strangely, Deadlock got me into this game, and I have to admit: it's awesome. I am truly terrible at it in every possible respect and am pretty sure I'll never be any good, but the art design is so cool (as usual), and it obviously reminds me of Warcraft III. It's free, and there are so many hero choices that you'll easily find one you'll enjoy playing, even if it's offline with bots. Check it out.","baik"
"76561198020365261","Ah, Dota 2. The game I love to hate and hate to love. 7,670.9 hours of my life have disappeared into this beautiful, frustrating void, and what do I have to show for it? A shiny Archon badge that mocks me every time I log in.  Let's start with the good, shall we? The depth of strategy in this game is unparalleled. With over 100 heroes, each with unique abilities, and a dizzying array of items, the possibilities are endless. Every match feels like a new puzzle to solve, a fresh challenge to overcome. The thrill of a well-executed team fight or a game-winning play? Pure dopamine.  But oh boy, the frustration. You'd think after nearly 7,700 hours, I'd be sitting pretty in the Divine ranks, right? WRONG. I'm still duking it out in the trenches of Archon and Legend, wondering if I'll ever see the promised land of Ancient. It's like being stuck in a time loop, but instead of Groundhog Day, it's Grounds for Uninstalling Day... except I never do.  The community? A mixed bag of wholesome teammates who restore your faith in humanity, and toxic players who make you question why you even bother. It's like a social experiment gone wrong, but somehow, I keep coming back for more.  And let's not forget the patches. Just when you think you've got the meta figured out, BAM! IceFrog drops a new update that turns everything on its head. Suddenly, your favorite hero is trash, and that hero you never touched is the new hotness. It's exciting and infuriating in equal measure.  Yet, despite all the rage quits, the ""cyka blyat"" spam, and the crushing defeats, there's something magical about Dota 2 that keeps pulling me back in. Maybe it's the hope that the next game will be THE game where everything clicks. Or perhaps I'm just a glutton for punishment.  So here I am, 7,670.9 hours deep, still chasing that Ancient dream. Will I ever get there? Who knows. But one thing's for sure - I'll be spending another 7,000 hours trying.  If you value your social life, your sleep schedule, or your sanity, stay far, far away from Dota 2. But if you're ready for a wild ride that will simultaneously be the best and worst gaming experience of your life, welcome to the club. I'll see you in the trenches of matchmaking... probably still sporting my Archon badge.","buruk"
"76561199391981562","The game itself is absolutely amazing and one of the best gaming experiences out there.   Sadly, the community that you have to immerse yourself in does not deserve/warrant that you spend your time, sanity and well-being in there. Toxicity is rampant. Quite literally every 1-2 games there is minimum one teammate actively griefing, trying their best to make your team lose, destroying items, AFK, cursing at everyone over voice comms or caps lock wishing cancer to you and your family. You cannot leave games, so you are forced to sit through the entire game and try your best to win despite the handicap and the absolutely toxic environment, it is simply not worth playing anymore...  Very little is done to punish wrongdoers, the punishment is way too soft. Doing Overwatch cases (you act as a judge) and seeing all the ways in which people willingly disrupt games and win chances makes you question the very fabric of human beings (or at least those addicted to this game). Stay away at all costs.","buruk"
"76561198036947714","It's a game that eats you all the time, I have over 9k games played, no matter how well you play, you find idiots who ruin your game and you have nothing to do...dislikes and reports, they don't produce any effect, and whatever you do, you can't find players to play their roles... the idea is that until something is done about it, it's NOT WORTH PLAYING you only get frustrated and angry.","buruk"
"76561198022256662","This game is awful, its toxic, the skill floor of this game is a mountain cliff, and the skill ceiling is infinite. I've played this game for 11k hours and i've never actually learned how to play it because i've only played support.  It's overly complicated, it's the game that is affected by skill inflation the most, its ruthless, its insanely toxic, and i regret every second i wasted on this game. No matter how much Valve tries to ease the skill floor with a bunch of QoL such as showing wards vision range or showing crowd control bars on enemies, this game will always be dota, and dota is for people that hate themselves and brings the worst in people.  If you are a new player, this game is impenetrable. Expect to lose the game in 15 minutes, and wait another 30 minutes by watching your base slowly crumpling, and getting fountain farmed to oblivion.  it's not fun to stomp, its not fun to get stomped, and it has e-sports mentality all over it, it is the most tryhard game in the market, Stay the heck away from this ruthless sweatland game. You have been warned.","buruk"
"76561198083256018","> trash matchmaking  > its like your mmr controlled by the system, so that you will get super addicted to this game  > after giving u winning streak with good team against super noob enemies, next it will pair u with trash team against good enemies  > its super rare to get balanced team  Conclusion? UNINSTALL! GOOD BYE DOTA 2 AFTER PLAYING IT SINCE 2013 T..T","buruk"
"76561198064407495","The higher u go the more account buyers and account boost buyers you encounter. They don't even try to hide it since Valve doesn't care.  Valve likes money and if a person is willing to swipe for an account/account boost they are most likely going to be willing to sub to DotA+ and buy skins.  DotA+ is another very big bait in my opinion depending on what you're buying it for. I bought it only for the predicted match quality and the ability to avoid people. Most of the games that had ""Ideal"" predicted match quality ended up in a hard one-sided stomp.  The game itself is amazing but it has become cancer to play due to an insane amount of people playing the game at a certain rank who do not belong there and just waste everybody else's time.  Do not get addicted like myself, skip until Valve decides to give real people jobs to deal with acc buyers/acc boost buyers and not rely on their community to identify them while wasting their time playing with the same people.","buruk"
"76561198004942146","I love the game, don't get me wrong, but save yourself the emotional pain. I'm already in too deep but there's still time for you to get out. Matchmaking is getting a whole lot better, but the community is so toxic. Recent hero customisations are criminally expensive.     You're your own person, and can make your own decisions, but it's far from uplifting and I wouldn't recommend anybody start.","buruk"
"76561198120223786","Negative Review of Dota 2    Dota 2 is one of the most overrated and toxic games I have ever encountered. Despite years of existence and Valve’s enormous resources, the game remains incredibly frustrating, mentally exhausting, and often unfair in every possible way.    1. Terrible Community  One of the main reasons people quit Dota 2 is its community. It is truly toxic: in almost every game, there is at least one player who either deliberately ruins the match or insults the entire team. The report system is practically useless—griefers and toxic players go unpunished, while you can get muted just for asking your team to play cooperatively.    2. Extremely High Learning Curve  Even if you want to learn the game, are willing to invest time, and try to understand the mechanics, Dota 2 doesn’t make it easy for you. There is no proper tutorial, and the sheer amount of information you need to memorize is overwhelming. Moreover, even if you become a skilled player, that doesn’t mean you’ll win—too much depends on teammates and pure luck.    3. Balance is a Myth  Heroes are either too strong or completely useless. Every patch shifts the meta so drastically that you have to relearn everything. Some heroes stay unplayable for months, making it pointless to invest time mastering them, as they may become irrelevant in just a couple of updates.    4. Matchmaking is a Lottery  The ranking system in Dota 2 is another source of frustration. Matchmaking works in such a way that sometimes you get a team that plays perfectly, and sometimes you get players who have no understanding of the game’s basics. There is no balance between teams, and your wins or losses are more dependent on luck than skill.    5. A Waste of Time  To make any real progress, you need to invest hundreds of hours, yet even after that, you won’t necessarily enjoy the game. Every match is either stressful or disappointing, and the feeling of satisfaction is extremely rare.    Conclusion  Dota 2 may seem interesting at first, but in reality, it drains your time, nerves, and energy. It is a game for those who are willing to endure toxicity, unbalanced mechanics, and frustration. If you’re looking for fun, it’s best to stay far away from this chaos.","buruk"
"76561198017043293","I do not recommend it. The community is toxic and the matchmaking is very unbalanced. People are rude, they report you for no reason. If you go to low priority due to a bad connection, it is a hell in Earth. Most of games people will not accept (9/10), people don't load the game, the search delays 5 to 10 minutes, and you will have  to win 4 games to leave this. The punishment is unfair, the game is just a bad addiction.","buruk"
"76561199808351855","Matchmaking system is just awful.  Add to that every game has a troll griefing/suiciding or a permanent disconnect, and it makes for just a terrible experience.","buruk"
